ClassifierScorers are **powerful** evaluators that can be created in minutes via Judgment's platform or SDK 
using **natural language criteria**.

3. Here, you can create a custom scorer by using a criteria in natural language, supplying custom arguments from the [`Example`](evaluation/data_examples) class. 
Then, you supply a set of **choices** the scorer can select from when evaluating an example. Finally, you can test your scorer on samples in our playground.

4. Once you're finished, you can save the scorer and use it in your evaluation runs just like any other scorer in `judgeval`.

### Example 

Here's an example of building a `ClassifierScorer` that checks if the LLM's tone is too aggressive. 
This might be useful when building a customer support chatbot.

<Tip>
A great use of ClassifierScorers is to prototype an evaluation criteria on a small set of examples before 
using it to benchmark your workflow.
