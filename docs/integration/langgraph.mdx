title: Integrating with LangGraph
---
We make it easy to integrate Judgeval with LangGraph. 


```python
from judgeval.common.tracer import Tracer

judgment = Tracer(api_key=os.getenv("JUDGMENT_API_KEY"), project_name=PROJECT_NAME)

graph_builder = StateGraph(State)

# YOUR LANGGRAPH WORKFLOW

handler = JudgevalCallbackHandler(judgment.get_current_trace())

result = graph.invoke({
    "messages": [HumanMessage(content=prompt)]
}, config=dict(callbacks=[handler]))

```
