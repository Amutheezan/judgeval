# Contextual Relevancy

The contextual relevancy scorer is a default LLM judge scorer that measures how relevant the contexts in `retrieval_context` are for an `input`. 
In practice, this scorer helps determine whether your RAG pipeline's retriever effectively retrieves relevant contexts for a query.

## Required Fields

To run the contextual relevancy scorer, you must include the following fields in your `Example`:
- `input`
- `actual_output`
- `retrieval_context`

## Scorer Breakdown

`ContextualRelevancy` scores are calculated by first extracting all statements in `retrieval_context` and then classifying which ones are relevant to the `input`.

The score is then calculated as:

$$
\text{Contextual Relevancy} = \frac{\text{Number of Relevant Statements}}{\text{Total Number of Statements}}
$$

TODO: add source paper for this approach

## Sample Implementation

```
from judgeval.judgment_client import JudgmentClient
from judgeval.data import Example
from judgeval.scorers import JudgmentScorer
from judgeval.constants import APIScorer

client = JudgmentClient()
example = Example(
    input="...",
    actual_output="...",
)
# supply your own threshold
scorer = JudgmentScorer(threshold=0.8, score_type=APIScorer.CONTEXTUAL_RELEVANCY)

results = client.run_evaluation(
    examples=[example],
    scorers=[scorer],
    model="gpt-4o",
)
print(results)
```

`Note:` 

The `ContextualRelevancy` scorer uses an LLM judge, so you'll receive a reason for the score in the `reason` field of the results. 
This allows you to double-check the accuracy of the evaluation and understand how the score was calculated.
