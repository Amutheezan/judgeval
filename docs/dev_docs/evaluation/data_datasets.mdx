# Datasets 

## Quick Summary
In most scenarios, you will have multiple `Example`s that you want to evaluate together.  
In `judgeval`, an evaluation dataset (`EvalDataset`) is a collection of `Example`s and/or `GroundTruthExample`s that you can scale evaluations across.

`Tip`:

A `GroundTruthExample` is a specific type of `Example` that do not require the `actual_output` field. This is useful for creating datasets that can be dynamically updated at evaluation time by running your workflow on the `GroundTruthExample`s to create `Example`s.
