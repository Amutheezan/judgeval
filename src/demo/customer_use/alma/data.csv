During this time, Mr. Lee proved to be an irreplaceable team member, expertly analyzing a large dataset of over 1.3 million political ads collected from social media platforms. Prior to joining this project, Mr. Lee had already displayed remarkable abilities through a prior project as a Research Assistant at the Center for Cybersecurity at UCLA. Under the guidance of Professor Justin Cappos, he worked on further securing automobile updates through the project Uptane. He utilized Python to implement hybrid encryption (RSA and AES-128) to encrypt updates and integrated security features to defend against attack vectors from compromised repositories. Moreover, he increased test coverage for Uptane by 5%. Additionally, he researched innovative techniques to build a compromise-resilient framework for updating IoT devices in the medical industry and Industrial Control Systems. Mr. Lee also contributed to redesigning the graduate-level course Application Security, offered both online and in-person to over 1,000 students at UCLA Tandon School of Engineering. His outstanding performance in these roles was a major reason I brought him onto the political ads project, confident in his ability to handle its complexities and challenges.

In the Online Political Ads Transparency Project, Mr. Lee's contributions were nothing short of extraordinary, particularly for a young researcher at the early stages of his career. He meticulously scraped and analyzed political advertisements released on social media websites using Python, successfully gathering over 500,000 unique ads stored in a PostgreSQL database. This immense task, handled with incredible precision and efficiency, provided a robust foundation for the project's findings. Demonstrating remarkable foresight, Mr. Lee open-sourced this data and our findings, making them accessible for further research and public scrutiny—an invaluable contribution to the field.

Additionally, Mr. Lee co-authored the related publication ""An Analysis of United States Online Political Advertising Transparency"" with me, cementing his status as a published researcher in a highly impactful study. Our paper analyzed over 1.3 million political ads and revealed critical insights into how different types of political advertisers disseminate U.S. political messages on social media platforms. We discovered that these ads generated between 8.67 billion to 33.8 billion impressions and that sponsors spent over $300 million USD on them. Our findings highlighted the significant presence of quasi for-profit media companies that create deceptive online communities, exploiting the lower regulatory requirements of online platforms compared to traditional media.

Mr. Lee's technical prowess and innovative thinking were further evidenced by his development of a custom labeling tool using Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This tool was specifically tailored for our dataset and significantly increased our labeling efficiency by over 500% through crowdsourcing efforts. Notably, our paper has been cited 62 times to date by prominent researchers, further demonstrating its impact in the field. For instance, it has been referenced in works on political advertising by EF Fowler et al. in the American Political Science Review, on ad delivery algorithms by M Ali et al. in the ACM Conference, and on Facebook's ad targeting systems by K Cotter et al. in Big Data & Society. The widespread recognition and citation of our research underscore its importance and the impressive quality of Mr. Lee’s contributions.

The impact of our research, much of which can be attributed to Mr. Lee's diligence and expertise, was widely recognized and featured in prestigious media outlets.

Dear Officer: 

This letter is written as a wholehearted endorsement of Mr. Michael Johnson as an individual of extraordinary ability in the field of process evaluation and development for the energy sector. Mr. Johnson's work involves the advanced methodologies of enhanced oil recovery through Low Salinity Water Injection (LSWI), a highly sophisticated process that enhances the efficiency of oil recovery from oil fields through the injection of chemically engineered waters.

As the Advisor Petrophysicist at Techsol Inc., a leading global independent energy company, I bring over 15 years of experience in the oil and gas industry. My expertise lies in petrophysics, a specialized discipline that focuses on the interactions between fluids and rocks in the subsurface. In my current role, I am responsible for interpreting and integrating petrophysical data with other subsurface disciplines across all phases of projects in the Nevada basin, spanning from exploration to appraisal and development. Prior to joining Techsol Inc., I held various roles at EnergyCo and Hydro Resources, including Exploration Petrophysicist, Appraisal Petrophysicist, and Development Petrophysicist. In these positions, I managed the design, execution, interpretation, and integration of formation evaluations for deep-water activities. Additionally, I gained foundational experience as a Petrophysicist and Field Engineer at Energy Services Group early in my career.

My educational background includes an ongoing MBA from California State University, an MSc in Petroleum Engineering from Oregon Institute of Technology, and a BSc in Mechanical Engineering from University of Michigan. This combination of technical expertise and business acumen has equipped me with the skills necessary to identify outstanding talent in this field. 

I first encountered Mr. Johnson's work during my tenure at EnergyCo, which later transitioned to Hydro Resources. At that time, EnergyCo/Hydro was involved in the Reservoir Simulation Joint Industry Project at University of Southern California, where Mr. Johnson was completing his graduate studies. As part of this project, he presented his master's thesis research, which focused on advanced methodologies for modeling Low Salinity Water Injection (LSWI) processes to enhance oil recovery. His research, which included proprietary data from our Trion project located in the Gulf of California, significantly aided our team in making crucial engineering design decisions for the Deep Water Trion Field. This contribution ultimately led to the successful sanctioning of the project by the company in June 2023.

Mr. Johnson's thesis, titled ""Comparison of Models for Numerical Simulation of Low Salinity Waterflood,"" tackles a critical and complex challenge in the oil and gas industry: accurately modeling Low Salinity Water Injection (LSWI) processes to optimize oil recovery. This groundbreaking research delves into the advanced technique of modifying the ionic composition of injected water to enhance oil displacement efficiency. The accuracy of these numerical simulations is pivotal for predicting oil recovery and making well-informed decisions regarding field development and investment. The innovative approach and comprehensive nature of this research are truly novel and set a new standard in the field.

In his pioneering thesis, Mr. Johnson meticulously compares three models for simulating LSWI using two different reservoir simulators: a coupled reservoir simulator with geochemistry capabilities (TechSim-Geo) and a commercial simulator (Simul8). He provides an in-depth analysis of the underlying mechanisms and theories behind each model and details the modeling capabilities of the two simulators. By applying these models to three distinct case studies—a synthetic carbonate field case, a sandstone coreflood from published literature, and another sandstone coreflood with unique mineralogy and petrophysical properties—Mr. Johnson's research demonstrates that the Extended Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek (EDLVO) model implemented in TechSim-Geo was the only model capable of accurately capturing wettability alteration during LSWI across all case studies. This groundbreaking finding underscores the vital importance of mechanistic modeling in LSWI simulation and provides invaluable insights for industry practitioners, highlighting the innovative and transformative nature of Mr. Johnson's work.

The broader implications of Mr. Johnson's research are truly transformative and extend far beyond the specifics of his case studies. By significantly enhancing the accuracy and reliability of LSWI modeling, his groundbreaking work paves the way for the development of more effective and efficient techniques for enhanced oil recovery.

Dear Reviewing Officer,

I'm writing to provide my strongest recommendation for Ms. Aidan Park, an individual of extraordinary ability as a data science engineer in the field of time series analysis and LLM applications.

To better place my comments in context, I'd like to first provide a brief personal background.

GIDA collaborates with Entrepreneur Academy to provide opportunities for select teams to participate in the esteemed Pioneer Training Program in Silicon Valley. I take great pride in facilitating these collaborations that nurture and empower talented entrepreneurs like Ms. Park.

Prior to my current role, I served as the Vice President at Tech Urban Development Company, where I played a pivotal role in advancing urban development and economic growth initiatives. From 2015 to 2018, I served as an Advisor to the Mayor’s Office in the City Government of Austin, contributing to the development and implementation of policies aimed at promoting Austin's growth as a hub for innovation. My earlier career includes experience as a Senior Specialist at the Economic Council, where I focused on labor policies and workforce development.

These competencies, along with my extensive experience in government and entrepreneurial ventures, enable me to effectively evaluate and support individuals like Ms. Park who demonstrate extraordinary potential in their fields.

My relationship with Ms. Aidan Park began when she was selected to participate in the GIDA x Pioneer Training Program at Entrepreneur Academy in the summer of 2023. As the Chief Administration Officer at GIDA, I have the privilege of facilitating this collaboration between our organization and Entrepreneur Academy. The program, which ran from May to June 2023, provided a unique opportunity for promising entrepreneurs like Ms. Park to receive advanced training and support in Silicon Valley. The Pioneer Training Program is renowned for its comprehensive curriculum that focuses on essential entrepreneurial skills such as startup ideation, product development, business strategy, and leadership. Participants have the chance to learn directly from industry experts, attend workshops and seminars, and engage in hands-on projects. The program also includes networking opportunities with venture capitalists and seasoned entrepreneurs, providing invaluable connections that can propel their ventures to new heights.

The Pioneer Training Program at Entrepreneur Academy is highly selective, admitting only a small percentage of applicants who demonstrate remarkable promise and capabilities. One of the main reasons Ms. Park was chosen for this prestigious program was her notable achievement at the OpenAI Stack Hack. This significant AI hackathon, organized by lablab.ai in February 2023, brought together 7,319 participants in 503 teams from around the world to develop innovative projects using OpenAI's latest AI tools, including Whisper, GPT-3, DALL-E 2, and Codex. The event serves as a platform for participants to showcase their abilities in solving real-world problems, learn from each other, and push the boundaries of AI technology.

Ms. Park's victory at the OpenAI Stack Hack, where she secured first place among over 500 global teams, is a testament to her expertise and innovative mindset.

Further illustrating her entrepreneurial prowess, Ms. Park founded InnovateAI, an innovative venture focused on developing AI solutions tailored to business needs. Under her leadership, the startup quickly gained traction due to its cutting-edge approach and potential to revolutionize various business processes. This promise led to its acceptance into the prestigious AI Accelerator Program, launched by Tech Visionaries, a leading venture capital firm.

The AI Accelerator supports high-potential AI startups by providing essential resources, mentorship, and networking opportunities required to scale their businesses successfully. Being accepted into this program highlights InnovateAI's standing as a leading player in the AI field and underscores the confidence that industry leaders have in Ms. Park's vision and capabilities.
