Excerpts: <filing_excerpts>
"On March 7, 2019, the FCO notified Tesla that the merger has been cleared by the FCO in accordance with the German ARC. Accordingly, the condition to the Offer and the Merger that any waiting period under the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated and any clearance required pursuant to the German ARC has been satisfied."

Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by adding a subsection immediately following the subsection entitled "Stockholder Approval Not Required," which new subsection is entitled "Legal Proceedings - Stockholder Litigation" and under such subsection, adding the following paragraphs:

"In connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, eight purported class action lawsuits have been filed. Five complaints, captioned Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00377 (filed February 26, 2019), Shiva Stein v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00395 (filed February 26, 2019), Joel Rosenfeld IRA v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al,. Case No. 3:19-cv-00413 (filed March 1, 2019), Franck Prissert v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00429 (filed March 4, 2019) and Jonathan Mantak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et. al, Case No. 3:19-cv-00451 (filed March 7, 2019) were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. One complaint, captioned John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00448 (filed March 4, 2019), was filed in the United States District Court District of Delaware. One complaint, captioned Davis Rodden v. Steven Bilodeau, et al,. Case No. 2019-0176 (filed March 4, 2019), was filed in the Delaware Chancery Court. One complaint, captioned Jack Phillipps v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al,. Case No. 1:19-cv-01927 (filed February 28, 2019), was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

In general, the complaints assert claims against the Company and the Company's Board, with Tesla and the Offeror as additional defendants in the Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al. and John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al. complaints. The complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants failed to make adequate disclosures in the Schedule 14D-9 filed by Maxwell Technologies on February 20, 2019. The complaints seek, among other things, to enjoin the proposed transaction, rescission of the proposed transaction should it be completed, and other equitable relief.

The Company believes the respective allegations against it in these complaints lack merit, and the Company intends to vigorously defend the actions.

The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complaints which are attached to the Schedule TO as Exhibit (a)(5)(D), Exhibit (a)(5)(E), Exhibit (a)(5)(F), Exhibit (a)(5)(G), Exhibit (a)(5)(H), Exhibit (a)(5)(I), Exhibit (a)(5)(J) and Exhibit (a)(5)(K), respectively."

Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 and the disclosure under the first sentence of the subsection entitled "Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" is hereby amended and restated as follows:

"Information both included and incorporated by reference in this document may contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act."

- **case number**: 3:19-cv-00377
- **case name**: Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al.
- **case filing date**: 2019-02-26
- **case count**: United States District Court for the Southern District of California
</target_case>

LLM Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is "Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00377". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following paragraph:

"Five complaints, captioned Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00377 (filed February 26, 2019), Shiva Stein v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00395 (filed February 26, 2019), Joel Rosenfeld IRA v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al,. Case No. 3:19-cv-00413 (filed March 1, 2019), Franck Prissert v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00429 (filed March 4, 2019) and Jonathan Mantak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et. al, Case No. 3:19-cv-00451 (filed March 7, 2019) were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California."

Since the Target Case is mentioned, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to look for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the Company has made supplemental disclosure:

"Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by adding a subsection immediately following the subsection entitled "Stockholder Approval Not Required," which new subsection is entitled "Legal Proceedings - Stockholder Litigation" and under such subsection, adding the following paragraphs:"

This indicates that the Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit. However, it is not explicitly stated that the supplemental disclosure is specifically in response to the Target Case. Since the supplemental disclosure is mentioned in the context of the lawsuits, including the Target Case, I will assume that it is associated with the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit "settlement" for the Target Case. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a "settlement" or "MOU" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal "XXX agreement" that indicates a resolution. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine whether an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since no agreement was found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, but it is not explicitly stated that the supplemental disclosure is specifically in response to the Target Case. However, since the supplemental disclosure is mentioned in the context of the lawsuits, including the Target Case, I will assume that it is associated with the Target Case. I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```
{
    "supplemental_disclosure": "Yes",
    "supplemental_disclosure_quote": "Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by adding a subsection immediately following the subsection entitled 'Stockholder Approval Not Required,' which new subsection is entitled 'Legal Proceedings - Stockholder Litigation' and under such subsection, adding the following paragraphs:",
    "reached_agreement": "No",
    "reached_agreement_quote": "Not applicable",
    "note": "The identified supplemental disclosure was not explicitly stated to be in response to the Target Case, but it was mentioned in the context of the lawsuits, including the Target Case."
}
```
Judge Inference Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to determine whether the Target Case is discussed in the filing excerpts. The Target Case is "Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00377". The filing excerpts mention the Target Case:

"Five complaints, captioned Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00377 (filed February 26, 2019)..."

Since the Target Case is mentioned, we can proceed to the next step.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The task now is to find an explicit mention that the Company has made or is planning a supplemental disclosure or amendment related to mergers in response to the lawsuit. In the filings, there is this statement:

"Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by adding a subsection immediately following the subsection entitled 'Stockholder Approval Not Required,' which new subsection is entitled 'Legal Proceedings - Stockholder Litigation' and under such subsection, adding the following paragraphs:"

This indicates that there was an amendment and supplementation but we must determine if this is in direct response to the lawsuits, particularly the Target Case. It appears that this is a disclosure made in the course of legal proceedings related to multiple lawsuits, including the Target Case. Thus, we assume it is related to the Target Case.

**Step 3, 4, 5: Search for Explicit Settlement, Other Agreements, and Implied Agreement**

The task is to find evidence of a settlement or agreement. Review of the excerpts shows:

- No explicit mention of a "Settlement Agreement" for the Target Case.
- No mention of a "MOU" or other formal agreement.
- No evidence suggesting a strongly implied agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since no agreement was identified, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The analysis concludes that there is a valid supplemental disclosure. It was made in the context of ongoing litigation, including the Target Case, thus it is assumed to be relevant. No explicit or implied agreements for the Target Case were found.

Here is the JSON format:

```
{
    "supplemental_disclosure": "Yes",
    "supplemental_disclosure_quote": "Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by adding a subsection immediately following the subsection entitled 'Stockholder Approval Not Required,' which new subsection is entitled 'Legal Proceedings - Stockholder Litigation' and under such subsection, adding the following paragraphs:",
    "reached_agreement": "No",
    "reached_agreement_quote": "Not applicable",
    "note": "The identified supplemental disclosure was made in the context of multiple lawsuits, including the Target Case."
}
```

Upon reviewing, the LLM correctly followed the task instructions for finding the relevant supplemental disclosure and evaluating possible agreements. No contradictions or misinterpretations occurred.

The disclosure under the heading "The Merger - Litigation Relating to the Merger" is hereby supplemented by adding the disclosures underlined below immediately after the first paragraph and before the second paragraph on page 70 of the Definitive Proxy Statement:

On March 18, 2019, Christopher Beveridge, a purported stockholder of Ellie Mae, filed a putative class action complaint against Ellie Mae and our Board of Directors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ("New York District Court"), captioned Christopher Beveridge v. Ellie Mae, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-02390. The complaint filed by Christopher Beveridge (the "Beveridge Complaint") alleges that Ellie Mae and our Board of Directors violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78(n)(a), 78(t)(a) respectively, Rule 14a-9 and 17 C.F.R. §240.14a-9 promulgated thereunder, by filing this Proxy Statement, which allegedly contains materially incomplete and misleading information about the Merger. Christopher Beveridge has asked the New York District Court to, among other things,(i) enjoin the defendants and all persons acting in concert with them from proceeding with the special meeting of Ellie Mae's stockholders to vote on the proposed transaction or consummating the proposed transaction, unless and until Ellie Mae discloses the material information that the Beveridge Complaint alleges has been omitted from the Proxy Statement, (ii) direct the defendants to account to plaintiff for all damages sustained as a result of their wrongdoing, and (iii) award plaintiff the costs and disbursement of the action, including reasonable allowance for plaintiff's attorneys' and experts' fees.

The complaint filed by Michael Stevens (the "Stevens Complaint") alleges that Ellie Mae and our Board of Directors violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1034, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78n(a), 78t(a), SEC Rule 14a-9, 17 C.F.R., 17 C.F.R. § 240.14a-9, and Regulation G, 17 C.F.R. § 244.1,00 by filing this Proxy Statement, which allegedly (a) omits material information required by federal securities laws and (b) contains untrue statements of fact and/or omits material facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading. Michelle Stevens has asked the California District Court to, among other things, (i) declare that the Stevens Complaint is properly maintained as a class action and certify plaintiff as class representative and her counsel as class counsel, (ii) enjoin the defendants and all persons acting in concert with them from proceeding with the special meeting of Ellie Mae's stockholders to vote on the proposed transaction or consummating the proposed transaction unless and until Ellie Mae discloses the material information that the Stevens Complaint alleges has been omitted from the Proxy Statement, (iii) direct Ellie Mae to account to plaintiff and the class for all damages sustained as result of their wrongdoing, and (iv) award plaintiff the costs of the action, included reasonable allowance for plaintiff's counsel and experts' fees.

Judge Inference Response: To determine whether the LLM's response contains a hallucination, let's assess whether it has incorrectly interpreted the task instructions or the evidence provided:

1. **Confirm Case Discussion**: The LLM correctly identifies that the Target Case, "Christopher Beveridge v. Ellie Mae, Inc." and matching case number, is discussed in the excerpts. This step is accurate based on the provided excerpts.

2. **Search for Supplemental Disclosure**: The LLM interprets a statement from the excerpts: "The disclosure under the heading 'The Merger - Litigation Relating to the Merger' is hereby supplemented by adding the disclosures underlined below..." to mean that Ellie Mae made a supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit. This interpretation seems reasonable given the context, although the direct link to the lawsuit is not explicitly stated in the excerpts.

3. **Search for Explicit Settlement**: The LLM states there is no explicit mention of a "Settlement Agreement" or "MOU" related to the Target Case. This is accurate as per the provided excerpts since no settlement or MOU is explicitly mentioned.

4. **Search for Other Agreements**: The LLM accurately notes there is no mention of another formal "XXX agreement."

5. **Handle Implied Agreement**: The LLM correctly concludes there is no implied agreement.

6. **Confirm the Agreement Pertains the Target Case**: Since no agreement was found, this step correctly does not apply.

7. **Summarize the Results**: The LLM summarizes that the Company has made supplemental disclosure but no agreement. This aligns with the provided excerpts.

Upon reviewing each step, the LLM's response appears correct. It does not contradict the information, misinterpret excerpts, or diverge from the task instructions. Therefore, there isn't any hallucination found in this response.

Docket ID: X1Q6O41D9R82
Excerpts: <filing_excerpts>
Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.), Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.), and Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.); one action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.); and one action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. The complaints generally alleged, among other things, that the Company and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement or that the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the proxy statement violated federal securities laws, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures, as of September 30, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot.

Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. §220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-TMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0589-TMR (July 31, 2019). The Company intends to vigorously defend against these actions.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019 sets forth information relating to other important risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Those risk factors, in addition to the other information set forth in this report, continue to be relevant to an understanding of our business, financial condition and operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2019.

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2019-0589
- **case name**: Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc.
- **case filing date**: 2019-07-31
- **case count**: Delaware Court of Chancery
</target_case>

LLM Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., Case No. 2019-0589-TMR. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following sentence:

"Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. §220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-TMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0589-TMR (July 31, 2019)."

Since the Target Case is mentioned, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following sentence:

"The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019."

However, this sentence does not explicitly state that the supplemental disclosure is in response to the lawsuit. But the following sentence provides more context:

"In light of those supplemental disclosures, as of September 30, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot."

This suggests that the supplemental disclosure is related to the complaints, which include the Target Case. Therefore, I will answer "Yes" for "supplemental_disclosure".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit "settlement" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a "settlement" or "MOU" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal "XXX agreement" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement, I will answer "No" for "reached_agreement".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my analysis, I will answer "Yes" for "supplemental_disclosure" and "No" for "reached_agreement".

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```
{
    "supplemental_disclosure": "Yes",
    "supplemental_disclosure_quote": "The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019.",
    "reached_agreement": "No",
    "reached_agreement_quote": "Not applicable",
    "note": "Case not mentioned in the context of an agreement."
}
```
Judge Inference Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The task is to first confirm whether the target case, Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., Case No. 2019-0589-TMR, is mentioned in the filing excerpts. The excerpts indeed contain a reference to this case under complaints filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery. Thus, there is a discussion of the target case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

Next, the LLM needs to identify whether the company has made or plans to make supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuit. The excerpts state, "The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019." While this indicates there was a supplemental disclosure, the key point is whether it was in response to the lawsuits, including the target case. The excerpts suggest the disclosures were linked to lawsuits as they note that after the supplemental disclosures, "each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot." This implies the disclosures were related to the complaints, including the target case. Thus, the LLM is correct in concluding "Yes" for "supplemental_disclosure".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to search for an explicit settlement or MOU related to the target case. There is no mention of a "Settlement Agreement" or "MOU" in relation to the target case in the excerpts.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**

Moreover, there is no mention of any other formal "XXX agreement" related to the target case in the excerpts provided.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The filing excerpts do not strongly imply the existence of an agreement for the target case either. 

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains to the Target Case**

Since no agreement has been found or implied, this step confirms there isn't an applicable agreement to the target case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The LLM concludes by answering "Yes" to the question of supplemental disclosure and "No" for reached agreements, supported by the provided excerpts.

While the LLM’s interpretation of the supplemental disclosure is reasonable and consistent with the excerpts, the provided quote for the supplemental disclosure does not show direct linkage to the lawsuits, an oversight for explicit contextual evidence. However, the context strongly suggested the connection pertains to the lawsuits referenced.

Upon this review, there is no contradiction or misinterpretation with the excerpts regarding supplemental disclosure, and the LLM correctly answers "No" for reached agreement without fabricating or misinterpreting evidence.

Overall, the LLM’s interpretation aligns with the task instructions without evidence of hallucination.

    "note": "Case not mentioned in the context of an agreement."

Item 8. | Additional Information.

Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by inserting at the end of the subsection titled "Certain Litigation" the disclosure set forth below:

"On October 31, 2018, a purported stockholder filed a lawsuit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned Joseph Pietras v. Richard D. Phillips, et al., Case No. 2018-0789 (Del. Ch.) (the "Pietras Chancery Complaint"). The Pietras Chancery Complaint names the Company Board, Sycamore Partners, Staples, Parent and Purchaser as defendants. The Pietras Chancery Complaint alleges that the Company Board breached its fiduciary duties and/or otherwise violated Delaware law (and that Sycamore Partners, Staples, Parent and Purchaser colluded in or aided and abetted in such violations) by, among other things, purportedly (i) failing to obtain the highest value available for the Company in the marketplace; (ii) initiating a process to sell the Company that purportedly undervalues the Company and vests the Company Board with benefits that are not shared equally by the Company's public stockholders; (iii) failing to provide in the Schedule 14D-9 all material information necessary for the Company's public stockholders to decide whether to tender their Shares in the Offer; and (iv) committing waste by approving the Contemplated Transactions. The Pietras Chancery Complaint seeks to enjoin the closing of the Offer unless and until the Company adopts a procedure to obtain a purportedly fairer agreement and discloses the requested information in the Schedule 14D-9 or, alternatively, to recover damages if the Offer closes without the adoption of such a procedure and the disclosure of such information. The Company believes that the action is without merit. The full complaint is attached hereto as Exhibit (a)(5)(T)."

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2018-0789
- **case name**: Joseph Pietras v. Richard D. Phillips, et al., Case No. 2018-0789
- **case filing date**: 2018-10-31
- **case count**: Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
</target_case>

LLM Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is "Joseph Pietras v. Richard D. Phillips, et al., Case No. 2018-0789". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the subsection titled "Certain Litigation" under Item 8. Therefore, I can confirm that the Target Case is discussed in the filing.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the Company has amended and supplemented Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 by inserting additional disclosure at the end of the subsection titled "Certain Litigation". This suggests that the Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit. However, I need to confirm that the lawsuit is the Target Case. The filing mentions that the Pietras Chancery Complaint was filed on October 31, 2018, which matches the case filing date of the Target Case. Therefore, I can confirm that the supplemental disclosure is associated with the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit "settlement" for the Target Case. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a "Settlement Agreement" or "MOU" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

Since I did not find any explicit settlement, the next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal "XXX agreement" that indicates a resolution. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

Since I did not find any explicit agreement, the next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I can summarize the results as follows:

* The Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, which is the Target Case.
* There is no explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

**Final Answer**

{
    "supplemental_disclosure": "Yes",
    "supplemental_disclosure_quote": "Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by inserting at the end of the subsection titled 'Certain Litigation' the disclosure set forth below:",
    "reached_agreement": "No",
    "reached_agreement_quote": "Not applicable",
    "note": "Case mentioned and supplemental disclosure made in response to the lawsuit."
}
Judge Inference Response: To determine whether the LLM has made a hallucination, let's analyze step by step:

**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

- The Target Case "Joseph Pietras v. Richard D. Phillips, et al., Case No. 2018-0789" is mentioned in the filing excerpts. The filing specifically refers to the lawsuit filed on October 31, 2018, in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, matching the Target Case details. The LLM correctly identifies that the case is discussed.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

- The filing excerpts state that "Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by inserting at the end of the subsection titled 'Certain Litigation.'" This is connected to the Pietras Chancery Complaint, which pertains to the Target Case. The LLM has accurately identified that supplemental disclosure is made in response to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

- No explicit mention of a "Settlement Agreement" or "MOU" is found in the filing excerpts. The LLM correctly states that there is no explicit settlement agreement.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

- The LLM did not identify any explicit mention of a formal agreement, which is correct as there are no such mentions in the excerpts.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

- The LLM did not find any strong implication of an agreement. This is consistent with the absence of any language implying an agreement within the filing excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains to the Target Case**

- Since no agreement was identified, this step is correctly deemed not applicable by the LLM.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

- The LLM correctly summarizes that there is supplemental disclosure and no explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

The LLM's response is consistent with the information provided in the filing excerpts and does not diverge from the task instructions. Therefore, there do not appear to be any contradictions, misinterpretations, or divergence from the instructions in the LLM's response.

**Final Determination:** The LLM has not made a hallucination in its response.

The Complaints generally allege, among other things, that MINDBODY and the members of its Board of Directors purportedly omitted material information from the Proxy Statement and that the Merger and the process that led to it was procedurally and substantively flawed. The Complaints also allege claims against the members of the Company's Board of Directors and, in the case of the Ryan Complaint, Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC. The Complaints seek, among other things, additional disclosure of facts relating to the Merger and/or injunctive relief. Additional similar lawsuits may be filed in the future. The Company believes that the plaintiffs' allegations in the Complaints lack merit and will vigorously defend against these and any subsequently filed similar actions. If additional similar complaints are filed, absent new or different allegations that are material, the Company will not necessarily disclose such additional filings. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Complaints which are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, 99.3 and 99.4 and incorporated by reference herein.

Additional Information and Where to Find It

In connection with the proposed Merger, MINDBODY has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and furnished to its stockholders a definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A, as well as other relevant documents concerning the proposed transaction. Promptly after filing its definitive proxy statement with the SEC, MINDBODY mailed the definitive proxy statement and a proxy card to each stockholder of MINDBODY entitled to vote at the special meeting relating to the proposed transaction. The proxy statement contains important information about the proposed Merger and related matters. STOCKHOLDERS AND SECURITY HOLDERS OF MINDBODY ARE URGED TO READ THESE MATERIALS (INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO) AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER THAT MINDBODY WILL FILE WITH THE SEC WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT MINDBODY AND THE TRANSACTION. This communication is not a substitute for the proxy statement or for any other document that MINDBODY may file with the SEC and send to its stockholders in connection with the proposed Merger. The proposed Merger will be submitted to MINDBODY's stockholders for their consideration. Before making any voting decision, stockholders of MINDBODY are urged to read the proxy statement regarding the Merger and any other relevant documents filed with the SEC, as well as any amendments or supplements to those documents, because they will contain important information about the proposed Merger.

Stockholders of MINDBODY are able to obtain a free copy of the proxy statement, as well as other filings containing information about MINDBODY and the proposed transaction, without charge, at the SEC's website (http://www.sec.gov).

<target_case>
- **case number**: 1:19-cv-00138
- **case name**: Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al.; Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al.
- **case filing date**: 2019-01-24
- **case count**: United States District Court of Delaware
</target_case>

LLM Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is "Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al." with case number "1:19-cv-00138". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the section "Litigation Related to the Merger" as one of the four stockholder class action lawsuits filed in connection with the Merger.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to look for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit "settlement" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a "Settlement Agreement" or "MOU" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will search for an explicit mention of a formal "XXX agreement" that indicates a resolution. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer "No" for "supplemental_disclosure" and "No" for "reached_agreement".

{
    "supplemental_disclosure": "No",
    "supplemental_disclosure_quote": "Not applicable",
    "reached_agreement": "No",
    "reached_agreement_quote": "Not applicable",
    "note": "Case not mentioned in the context of supplemental disclosure or agreement."
}
Judge Inference Response: To determine if there is any hallucination in the LLM's response, let's analyze the information:

1. **Confirm Case Discussion**: The Target Case, "Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al." with case number "1:19-cv-00138", is indeed mentioned in the filing excerpts as one of the stockholder class action lawsuits filed in connection with the merger. The LLM correctly identifies this.

2. **Search for Supplemental Disclosure**: The excerpts do not explicitly mention that MINDBODY, Inc. has agreed or planned to make supplemental disclosure or amendments in response to the lawsuit. The LLM concludes "No" for supplemental disclosure, which aligns with the provided excerpts.

3. **Search for Explicit Settlement**: The excerpts lack any explicit mention of a "Settlement Agreement" or "MOU" related to the case. The LLM rightly finds no explicit settlement information.

4. **Search for other Agreements**: There is no explicit mention of any formal agreement such as an "XXX agreement" related to the case, which the LLM correctly identifies.

5. **Handle Implied Agreement**: The LLM doesn't find a strong implication of any agreement, which is accurate, given the provided text.

6. **Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**: As there were no agreements found, this step is not applicable.

The LLM's conclusion in Step 7, providing "No" for both "supplemental_disclosure" and "reached_agreement", is in accordance with the information from the excerpts. Additionally, the provided JSON output aligns with the instructions, stating "Not applicable" where applicable.

In conclusion, the LLM has correctly interpreted and responded in alignment with the task instructions and the provided excerpts. There is no evidence of contradiction, misinterpretation, or divergence in the task that indicates a hallucination.

**Therefore, the final answer is:** <answer>False</answer>

LLM Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00138. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the section describing the complaints filed against MINDBODY, Inc.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since the Target Case is mentioned, the next step is to determine whether there is an explicit "settlement" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a "settlement" or "MOU" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal "XXX agreement" that indicates a resolution. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since no agreement was found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the review of the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any evidence of supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

{
    "supplemental_disclosure": "No",
    "supplemental_disclosure_quote": "Not applicable",
    "reached_agreement": "No",
    "reached_agreement_quote": "Not applicable",
    "note": "Case not mentioned in the context of supplemental disclosure or agreement."
}
Judge Inference Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The task instructs to ensure that the Target Case, "Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00138", is discussed in the filing excerpts. The excerpts do mention the Sabatini case as part of the several complaints filed against MINDBODY, Inc.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The task requires checking if there is an explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the excerpts, there is no explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure in response to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step involves determining if there is an explicit "settlement" for the Target Case. This would require an explicit mention of a "Settlement Agreement" or an "MOU" for the Target Case, which does not appear in the filing excerpts provided.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

Step four involves looking for an explicit mention of a formal "XXX agreement" indicating a resolution, which is not found in the filing excerpts in relation to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The task requires classifying as 'Yes (Implied Agreement)' if an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. There is no strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case in the excerpts provided.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since no agreement was found to be related to the Target Case, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The LLM's task is to summarize whether any supplemental disclosure or explicit agreement is related to the Target Case based on the filed documents. In the excerpts, there is no evidence of supplemental disclosure or agreement.

**Analysis**:

- The LLM correctly identifies that the Target Case is discussed.
- The LLM correctly identifies no evidence for supplemental disclosure.
- The LLM correctly assesses there is no evidence of a settlement, MOU, other agreement, or any implied agreement.

Thus, the LLM's response is consistent with the task requirements and the provided excerpts.

LLM Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is "Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al." with case number "1:19-cv-00138". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit 99.1, which is a complaint filed on January 24, 2019. Therefore, the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit "settlement" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a "settlement" or "MOU" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will search for an explicit mention of a formal "XXX agreement" that indicates a resolution. However, I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will check if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. However, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer "No" for "supplemental_disclosure" and "No" for "reached_agreement".

{
    "supplemental_disclosure": "No",
    "supplemental_disclosure_quote": "Not applicable",
    "reached_agreement": "No",
    "reached_agreement_quote": "Not applicable",
    "note": "Case not mentioned in the context of supplemental disclosure or agreement."
}
Judge Inference Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The filing excerpts do mention the case "Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al." with the case number "1:19-cv-00138", as seen in Exhibit 99.1. The LLM correctly identified that the Target Case is discussed in the filing excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The LLM checked for any explicit mention of the company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit. The filing excerpts do not contain any reference to supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The LLM noted the absence of any mention of a "settlement" or "MOU" related to the Target Case in the excerpts. This observation is consistent with the provided excerpts.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The LLM did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case. This step was completed accurately as there is no such indication in the excerpts.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

There is no strong implication of an agreement present in the excerpts. The LLM did not identify any such implication, and this aligns with the content of the excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

The absence of any agreement eliminates the need to confirm its relevance to the Target Case. The LLM appropriately moved to the next step.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The LLM's conclusion that there is "No" supplemental disclosure and "No" reached agreement is consistent with the analysis and the excerpts provided.

Overall, the LLM's response did not contradict or misinterpret the excerpts, nor did it diverge from the task instructions. Therefore, no hallucination is present in the response.

The Complaints generally allege, among other things, that MINDBODY and the members of its Board of Directors purportedly omitted material information from the Proxy Statement and that the Merger and the process that led to it was procedurally and substantively flawed. The Complaints also allege claims against the members of the Company's Board of Directors and, in the case of the Ryan Complaint, Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC. The Complaints seek, among other things, additional disclosure of facts relating to the Merger and/or injunctive relief. Additional similar lawsuits may be filed in the future. The Company believes that the plaintiffs' allegations in the Complaints lack merit and will vigorously defend against these and any subsequently filed similar actions. If additional similar complaints are filed, absent new or different allegations that are material, the Company will not necessarily disclose such additional filings. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Complaints which are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, 99.3 and 99.4 and incorporated by reference herein.

Additional Information and Where to Find It

In connection with the proposed Merger, MINDBODY has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and furnished to its stockholders a definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A, as well as other relevant documents concerning the proposed transaction. Promptly after filing its definitive proxy statement with the SEC, MINDBODY mailed the definitive proxy statement and a proxy card to each stockholder of MINDBODY entitled to vote at the special meeting relating to the proposed transaction. The proxy statement contains important information about the proposed Merger and related matters. STOCKHOLDERS AND SECURITY HOLDERS OF MINDBODY ARE URGED TO READ THESE MATERIALS (INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO) AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER THAT MINDBODY WILL FILE WITH THE SEC WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT MINDBODY AND THE TRANSACTION. This communication is not a substitute for the proxy statement or for any other document that MINDBODY may file with the SEC and send to its stockholders in connection with the proposed Merger. The proposed Merger will be submitted to MINDBODY's stockholders for their consideration. Before making any voting decision, stockholders of MINDBODY are urged to read the proxy statement regarding the Merger and any other relevant documents filed with the SEC, as well as any amendments or supplements to those documents, because they will contain important information about the proposed Merger.

Stockholders of MINDBODY are able to obtain a free copy of the proxy statement, as well as other filings containing information about MINDBODY and the proposed transaction, without charge, at the SEC's website (http://www.sec.gov). Copies of the proxy statement, and the filings with the SEC that will be incorporated by reference therein can also be obtained, without charge, by contacting MINDBODY's Investor Relations at (888) 782-7155, by email at IR@mindbodyonline.com, or by going to MINDBODY's Investor Relations page on its website at investors.mindbodyonline.com and clicking on the link titled "Financials & Filings" to access MINDBODY's "SEC Filings."

Participants in the Solicitation

MINDBODY and certain of its directors, executive officers and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies in respect of the proposed Merger. Information regarding the interests of MINDBODY's directors and executive officers and their ownership of Company Common Stock is set forth in MINDBODY's definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on January 23, 2019, in connection with the proposed Merger, MINDBODY's proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on April 5, 2018, and certain of its Current Reports on Form 8-K.

<target_case>
- **case number**: 1:19-cv-00138
- **case name**: Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al.; Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al.
- **case filing date**: 2019-01-24
- **case count**: United States District Court of Delaware
</target_case>

LLM Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is "Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al." with case number "1:19-cv-00138". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the section "Litigation Related to the Merger" as one of the four stockholder class action lawsuits filed in connection with the Merger.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to look for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit "settlement" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a "Settlement Agreement" or "MOU" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will search for an explicit mention of a formal "XXX agreement" that indicates a resolution. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will not proceed with confirming whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer "No" for "supplemental_disclosure" and "No" for "reached_agreement".

{
    "supplemental_disclosure": "No",
    "supplemental_disclosure_quote": "Not applicable",
    "reached_agreement": "No",
    "reached_agreement_quote": "Not applicable",
    "note": "Case not mentioned in the context of supplemental disclosure or agreement."
}
Judge Inference Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first task is to confirm whether the Filing Excerpts mention the Target Case, "Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al." with case number "1:19-cv-00138". The Filing Excerpts do mention this case, identifying it as one of the four stockholder class action lawsuits related to the merger.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to identify whether there is an explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the Target Case. There is no explicit mention of any supplemental disclosure or amendment made or planned by MINDBODY in response to the lawsuit in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The instruction is to find if there is an explicit "settlement" mentioned for the Target Case. There is no explicit mention of a "Settlement Agreement" or "MOU" related to this case in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

Next, the task is to search for any explicit mention of a formal agreement that resolves the issues in the Target Case. There is no mention of such an agreement related to the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

Check if there is a strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case. No strong implication of an agreement was identified in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains to the Target Case**

Since no agreement was found, confirmation that an agreement pertains specifically to the Target Case is unnecessary.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, the conclusion aligns with the LLM response. There is no evidence of supplemental disclosures or agreements specifically pertaining to the Target Case. Therefore, both answers are "No."

{
    "supplemental_disclosure": "No",
    "supplemental_disclosure_quote": "Not applicable",
    "reached_agreement": "No",
    "reached_agreement_quote": "Not applicable",
    "note": "Case not mentioned in the context of supplemental disclosure or agreement."
}

Upon review, the LLM's response adheres to the task instructions. There is no evidence of a hallucination in the LLM's response based on the provided excerpts.

There is no explicit mention of a settlement agreement or MOU related to the Target Case in the provided excerpts. The LLM correctly noted the absence of any such mention for a settlement or MOU.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

Upon reviewing the LLM's response and the excerpts, the findings are consistent with the provided information. The LLM did not make any errors in interpretation or contradiction of the task instructions. Therefore, there is no hallucination in its response.

LLM Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is "Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al." with case number "1:19-cv-00138". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit 99.1, which is a complaint filed on January 24, 2019. Therefore, the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit "settlement" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a "settlement" or "MOU" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal "XXX agreement" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

There is no implied agreement mentioned in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since there is no agreement mentioned, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I did not find any evidence of supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

    "supplemental_disclosure_quote": "Not applicable",
    "reached_agreement": "No",
    "reached_agreement_quote": "Not applicable",
    "note": "Case not mentioned in the context of supplemental disclosure or agreement."

Judge Inference Response: **Analysis of Possible Contradictions and Misinterpretations:**

1. **Confirm Case Discussion:** The LLM correctly identified that the Target Case, "Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al." with case number "1:19-cv-00138", is mentioned in the Filing Excerpts as Exhibit 99.1. This step is correctly executed as the case is indeed discussed.

2. **Search for Supplemental Disclosure:** The LLM concluded that there was no mention of supplemental disclosure related to the lawsuit in the Filing Excerpts. Upon reviewing the excerpts, there is no explicit mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment made by the Company in response to the Target Case. The LLM's finding is correct.

3. **Search for Explicit Settlement:** The LLM did not find any mention of a "settlement" or "MOU" related to the case. The excerpts provided do not contain any explicit mention of settlement agreements or MOUs. The LLM's analysis is correct.

4. **Search for Other Agreements:** The LLM did not find any formal agreements mentioned, and the Filing Excerpts do not specify any such agreements. This step is accurately performed.

5. **Handle Implied Agreement:** The LLM did not identify any implied agreement, which aligns with the absence of any suggestion or strongly implied resolution in the Filing Excerpts.

6. **Confirm the agreement pertains to the Target Case:** Since no agreement was found, this step indeed becomes redundant.

**Analysis of Task Instruction Divergence:**

- The LLM followed the task instructions accurately by analyzing each required aspect: confirming discussion of the target case, searching for supplemental disclosure, explicit settlements, and other agreements, and verifying if any agreement pertained specifically to the Target Case.

Based on this analysis, the LLM did not make any erroneous assumptions or interpretations and adhered closely to the task instructions.

**Conclusion:**

The LLM has not made a hallucination in its response. It accurately reports that there is no evidence of supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case based on the information provided in the filing excerpts.

The Ryan Complaint alleges, among other things, that the irrevocable proxies granted by Richard Stollmeyer, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company Board, certain parties related to Richard Stollmeyer, and Institutional Venture Partners XIII, L.P. (the "Signing Stockholders") caused a transfer of voting control of the Signing Stockholders' Class B common stock, which in turn caused the Signing Stockholders' shares of Class B common stock to be automatically converted into shares of Class A common stock entitled to one vote for each such share of Class A common stock, as opposed to ten votes for each share of Class B common stock. If, as alleged in the Ryan Complaint, the Class B common stock held by the Signing Stockholders were converted into shares of Class A common stock, then, as of the Record Date: (i) there would have been 47,763,583 shares of Class A common stock and 252,950 shares of Class B common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, (ii) 25,146,542 votes would constitute a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY common stock required to adopt the Merger Agreement and the holders of such majority of the voting power would constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting, (iii) the Signing Stockholders would have held, in the aggregate, approximately 6.33% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY's common stock (and approximately 8.43% when taking into account MINDBODY options and RSUs held, in the aggregate, by the Signing Stockholders), and (iv) our directors and executive officers would have held, in the aggregate, approximately 1.33% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY's common stock (and approximately 9.33% when taking into account MINDBODY options and RSUs held, in the aggregate, by our directors and executive officers). The Company vigorously disputes the allegations in the Ryan Complaint and the claim that the Signing Stockholders' shares of Class B common stock were converted into Class A common stock, and believes that the numbers and percentages as of the Record Date are as set forth in the Proxy Statement. However, even if the Class B common stock were converted into Class A common stock as alleged in the Ryan Complaint, the Board of Directors nonetheless encourages stockholders to vote "FOR" the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the other proposals set forth in the Proxy Statement.

As previously disclosed in the Company's Schedule 14A, also filed on January 29, 2019, counsel for Luxor Capital Partners, LP, Luxor Wavefront, LP, Lugard Road Capital Master Fund, LP, Luxor Capital Partners Offshore Master Fund, LP, Luxor Capital Partners Offshore, Ltd., Luxor Capital Group, LP, LCG Holdings, LLC, Lugard Road Capital GP, LLC and Luxor Management, LLC (together, "Luxor") sent a demand letter ("the Luxor Demand Letter") to MINDBODY pursuant to Section 220(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL").

After the Company's January 29th filings, on January 30, 2019, Luxor filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of Delaware, captioned Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc., Case No. 2019-0070 (the "Luxor Complaint"), included below, on January 31, 2019, Hyan Tang, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a putative class action suit in the United States District Court of Delaware, captioned Tang v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00210-UNA (the "Tang Complaint"), included below; and on February 4, 2019, Sunil Kumar, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a putative class action suit in the United States District Court of the Central District of California, captioned Kumar v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. (the "Kumar Complaint," included below, and together with the Sabatini Complaint, the Schmit Complaint, the Tran Complaint, the Ryan Complaint, the Luxor Complaint and the Tang Complaint, the "Complaints").

The following documents in connection with the Luxor Complaint are also included below: Luxor's Motion to Expedite, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on January 30, 2019, Luxor's Statement of Good Cause, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on January 30, 2019, MINDBODY's Opposition to Luxor's Motion to Expedite, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on February 1, 2019, Luxor's Reply to MINDBODY's Opposition, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on February 4, 2019, and the Order of the Court of Chancery of Delaware, granted on February 4, 2019.

The Company believes the Complaints are without merit, and the Company has vigorously defended and continues to vigorously defend against the Complaints.

While the Company believes that the disclosures set forth in the Proxy Statement comply fully with applicable law, in order to moot plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Complaints, avoid nuisance and possible expense, and provide additional information to the Company's stockholders, the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the "Supplemental Disclosures"). Nothing in the Supplemental Disclosures shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the Complaints that any additional disclosure was or is required.

Supplemental Disclosures to Proxy Statement

The following supplemental information should be read in conjunction with the Proxy Statement, which should be read in its entirety. All page references are to pages in the Proxy Statement, and terms used below, unless otherwise defined, have the meanings set forth in the Proxy Statement. Underlined text shows text being added to a referenced disclosure in the Proxy Statement and a line through text shows text being deleted from a referenced disclosure in the Proxy Statement.

The disclosure under the heading "The Merger--Background of the Merger" is hereby supplemented by adding the underlined disclosure after the first paragraph under that heading on page 26 of the Proxy Statement:

In the first half of August 2018, as part of Qatalyst Partners' customary coverage of software companies, a representative of Qatalyst Partners had a meeting with Mr. Stollmeyer. Following this meeting, Qatalyst Partners reached out to Vista, Party A, and Party B as typical outreach to connect strategic companies, including MINDBODY, to such parties.

Separately, on August 7, 2018, a representative of Vista emailed Mr. Stollmeyer, offering to meet for lunch, which took place on September 4, 2018, and at which Mr. Stollmeyer provided the representative of Vista with a general overview of MINDBODY and its approach to the fitness, beauty and wellness services industries as was typical for Mr. Stollmeyer to present to potential investors.

On September 19, 2018, Mr. Stollmeyer received an invitation from the representative of Vista to attend an annual "meet and greet" conference hosted by Vista bringing together hundreds of executives in the technology sector, including from Vista's portfolio companies.

The disclosure under the heading "The Merger--Background of the Merger" is hereby supplemented by adding the underlined disclosure in the second paragraph under that heading on page 26 of the Proxy Statement:

<target_case>
- **case number**: 1:19-cv-00138
- **case name**: Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al.; Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al.
- **case filing date**: 2019-01-24
- **case count**: United States District Court of Delaware
</target_case>

LLM Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00138. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the Target Case is not explicitly mentioned. However, the Filing Excerpts do mention other cases, such as the Luxor Complaint, the Tang Complaint, and the Kumar Complaint, but not the Sabatini case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

Since the Target Case is not mentioned, I will answer "No" for "supplemental_disclosure" and proceed to the next step.

**Step 3-7: Not Applicable**

Since the Target Case is not mentioned, I will not proceed with the remaining steps.

**Final Answer**

{
    "supplemental_disclosure": "No",
    "supplemental_disclosure_quote": "Not applicable",
    "reached_agreement": "No",
    "reached_agreement_quote": "Not applicable",
    "note": "Case not mentioned."
}
Judge Inference Response: Let's analyze the LLM's response to identify any hallucinations.

**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

- The LLM correctly identifies that the Target Case, "Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc." is not mentioned in the Filing Excerpts. The Filing Excerpts do mention several other cases, but not the Sabatini case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

- Following the task instructions, since the Target Case is not mentioned, the LLM correctly answers "No" for "supplemental_disclosure" as there is no relevant information applicable to the Target Case.

**Steps 3-7:** 

- As the Target Case is not mentioned, proceeding with further steps is unnecessary. The LLM appropriately concludes with the answers that reflect the absence of any discussion about the Target Case.

**Final Answer Analysis**

- The final output JSON is consistent with the observations: it states "No" for both "supplemental_disclosure" and "reached_agreement," with quotes marked "Not applicable" due to the non-mention of the Target Case. The note accurately reflects "Case not mentioned."

The LLM response follows the task instructions correctly and makes appropriate interpretations based on the provided excerpts. There are no hallucinations detected in its process or understanding.

**Conclusion**

The LLM has not made a hallucination. The analysis and final answers align correctly with the task requirements and filing excerpts.

Excerpts: <filing_excerpts>
(i) | in the United States District Court of Delaware, captioned Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00138-UNA (the "Sabatini Complaint");

(ii) | in California Superior Court of San Luis Obispo County, captioned Schmit v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 19CV-0043 (the "Schmit Complaint");

(iii) | in the United States District Court of Central District of California, captioned Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2:19-cv-00638 (the "Tran Complaint"); and

(iv) | in the Court of Chancery of Delaware, captioned Ryan v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2019-0061 (the "Ryan Complaint," and together with the Sabatini Complaint, Schmit Complaint, and Tran Complaint, the "Complaints")

The Complaints generally allege, among other things, that MINDBODY and the members of its Board of Directors purportedly omitted material information from the Proxy Statement and that the Merger and the process that led to it was procedurally and substantively flawed. The Complaints also allege claims against the members of the Company's Board of Directors and, in the case of the Ryan Complaint, Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC. The Complaints seek, among other things, additional disclosure of facts relating to the Merger and/or injunctive relief. Additional similar lawsuits may be filed in the future. The Company believes that the plaintiffs' allegations in the Complaints lack merit and will vigorously defend against these and any subsequently filed similar actions. If additional similar complaints are filed, absent new or different allegations that are material, the Company will not necessarily disclose such additional filings. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Complaints which are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, 99.3 and 99.4 and incorporated by reference herein.

Additional Information and Where to Find It

In connection with the proposed Merger, MINDBODY has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and furnished to its stockholders a definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A, as well as other relevant documents concerning the proposed transaction. Promptly after filing its definitive proxy statement with the SEC, MINDBODY mailed the definitive proxy statement and a proxy card to each stockholder of MINDBODY entitled to vote at the special meeting relating to the proposed transaction. The proxy statement contains important information about the proposed Merger and related matters. STOCKHOLDERS AND SECURITY HOLDERS OF MINDBODY ARE URGED TO READ THESE MATERIALS (INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO) AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER THAT MINDBODY WILL FILE WITH THE SEC WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT MINDBODY AND THE TRANSACTION. This communication is not a substitute for the proxy statement or for any other document that MINDBODY may file with the SEC and send to its stockholders in connection with the proposed Merger. The proposed Merger will be submitted to MINDBODY's stockholders for their consideration. Before making any voting decision, stockholders of MINDBODY are urged to read the proxy statement regarding the Merger and any other relevant documents filed with the SEC, as well as any amendments or supplements to those documents, because they will contain important information about the proposed Merger.

Stockholders of MINDBODY are able to obtain a free copy of the proxy statement, as well as other filings containing information about MINDBODY and the proposed transaction, without charge, at the SEC's website (http://www.sec.gov). Copies of the proxy statement, and the filings with the SEC that will be incorporated by reference therein can also be obtained, without charge, by contacting MINDBODY's Investor Relations at (888) 782-7155, by email at IR@mindbodyonline.com, or by going to MINDBODY's Investor Relations page on its website at investors.mindbodyonline.com and clicking on the link titled "Financials & Filings" to access MINDBODY's "SEC Filings."

Participants in the Solicitation

MINDBODY and certain of its directors, executive officers and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies in respect of the proposed Merger. Information regarding the interests of MINDBODY's directors and executive officers and their ownership of Company Common Stock is set forth in MINDBODY's definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on January 23, 2019, in connection with the proposed Merger, MINDBODY's proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on April 5, 2018, and certain of its Current Reports on Form 8-K. Other information regarding the participants in the proxy solicitation and a description of their direct and indirect interests in the proposed Merger, by security holdings or otherwise, are contained in the proxy statement and may be contained in other relevant materials to be filed with the SEC in connection with the proposed Merger. Free copies of this document may be obtained as described in the preceding paragraph.

Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This communication, and any documents to which MINDBODY refers you in this communication, contains not only historical information, but also forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements represent MINDBODY's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events, including but not limited to the expected completion and timing of the proposed transaction, expected benefits and costs of the proposed transaction, management plans and other information relating to the proposed transaction, strategies and objectives of MINDBODY for future operations and other information relating to the proposed transaction. Without limiting the foregoing, the words "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "expects," "intends," "forecasts," "should," "estimates," "contemplate," "future," "goal," "potential," "predict," "project," "projection," "target," "seek," "may," "will," "could," "should," "would," "assuming," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. You should read any such forward-looking statements carefully, as they involve a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ significantly from those projected or contemplated in any such forward-looking statement. Those risks, uncertainties and assumptions include (i) the risk that the proposed transaction may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, which may adversely affect MINDBODY's business and the price of the common stock of MINDBODY, (ii) the failure to satisfy any of the conditions to the consummation of the proposed transaction, including the adoption of the merger agreement by the stockholders of MINDBODY and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, (iii) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance or condition that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement, (iv) the effect of the announcement or pendency of the proposed transaction on MINDBODY's business relationships, operating results and business generally, (v) risks that the proposed transaction disrupts current plans and operations and the potential difficulties in employee retention as a result of the proposed transaction, (vi) risks related to diverting management's attention from MINDBODY's ongoing business operations, (vii) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against MINDBODY related to the merger agreement or the proposed transaction, (viii) unexpected costs, charges or expenses resulting from the proposed transaction, and (ix) other risks described in MINDBODY's filings with the SEC, such as its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Reports on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this communication or the date of any document incorporated by reference in this document. Except as required by applicable law or regulation, MINDBODY does not assume any obligation to update any such forward-looking statements whether as the result of new developments or otherwise.

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2:19-cv-00638
- **case name**: Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al.; Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al.
- **case filing date**: 2019-01-28
- **case count**: United States District Court of Central District of California
</target_case>

LLM Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is "Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al." with case number 2:19-cv-00638. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following paragraph:

"(iii) | in the United States District Court of Central District of California, captioned Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2:19-cv-00638 (the "Tran Complaint");"

This confirms that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a "Settlement Agreement" or "MOU" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will proceed to search for an explicit mention of a formal "XXX agreement" that indicates a resolution. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will proceed to check if an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I did not find any supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```
{
    "supplemental_disclosure": "No",
    "supplemental_disclosure_quote": "Not applicable",
    "reached_agreement": "No",
    "reached_agreement_quote": "Not applicable",
    "note": "Case not mentioned in the context of supplemental disclosure or agreement."
}
```
Judge Inference Response: To determine if the LLM has made a hallucination, I will analyze its response based on the provided instructions and excerpts.

**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The task is to confirm if the Target Case, "Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc.," is mentioned in the excerpts. The LLM correctly identifies this case as being mentioned in the filing excerpts. There is no contradiction or misinterpretation here.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The task required finding explicit mentions of supplemental disclosure related to the merger in response to the lawsuit. The LLM found no such mention, which aligns with the information provided in the excerpts. The excerpts discuss the filing of a proxy statement and other documents related to the merger, but nothing explicitly indicates supplemental disclosures were made in response to the lawsuit. The LLM correctly responded "No" for this part without misinterpretation.

**Step 3-5: Search for Explicit or Implied Agreements**

The task required searching for any explicit or implied agreements. The LLM correctly identifies that there is no mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or another formal agreement within the excerpts. The excerpts do not mention any resolution or agreement concerning the lawsuit, and hence, the LLM's response of "No" is accurate here as well.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains to the Target Case**

Since no agreements were identified in the prior steps, this step is not applicable, and the LLM appropriately recognized it.

**Conclusion**

The LLM's response is consistent with the excerpts and follows the task instructions accurately in each step. The interpretation of the information is correct, and no steps were omitted. The final JSON output provided by the LLM corresponds appropriately with the findings.

**Final Determination**

The LLM's response does not exhibit any hallucinations.

LLM Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is "Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2:19-cv-00638". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the section describing the complaints filed against MINDBODY.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit "settlement" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a "settlement" or "MOU" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal "XXX agreement" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will not proceed with confirming whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer "No" for "supplemental_disclosure" and "No" for "reached_agreement".

Here is the JSON object with the final answer:

{
    "supplemental_disclosure": "No",
    "supplemental_disclosure_quote": "Not applicable",
    "reached_agreement": "No",
    "reached_agreement_quote": "Not applicable",
    "note": "Case not mentioned in the context of supplemental disclosure or agreement."

Judge Inference Response: Upon reviewing the task instructions and the LLM's response, here is the breakdown of the analysis:

1. **Confirm Case Discussion**: 
   - The task requires checking if the Filing Excerpts discuss the Target Case ("Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2:19-cv-00638"). The excerpts do indeed mention this case, as outlined in the response under the complaints against MINDBODY. Thus, the response correctly states that the target case is discussed.

2. **Search for Supplemental Disclosure**:
   - The next step is to search for any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to lawsuits. The LLM correctly identifies that there is no explicit mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment in the excerpts related to the lawsuit, including the Target Case.

3. **Search for Explicit Settlement**:
   - The task requires checking for an explicit mention of a "Settlement Agreement" or "MOU" related to the case. The LLM correctly reports that there is no such mention found in the Filing Excerpts.

4. **Search for Other Agreements**:
   - The task instructions direct the LLM to search for any other formal agreements that might indicate a resolution. The LLM's response correctly states that no formal "XXX agreement" indicating a resolution was found.

5. **Handle Implied Agreement**:
   - The instructions specify that if an agreement is strongly implied without explicit mention, it should be classified as "Yes (Implied Agreement)." The LLM accurately identifies that no such strong implication was found.

6. **Confirm the Agreement Pertains the Target Case**:
   - Since no agreement was found, this step is not applicable.

7. **Summarize the Results**:
   - The final answers provided in the JSON format are "No" for both supplemental disclosure and reached agreement. These answers are consistent with the findings that there was neither mention of supplemental disclosure nor any agreements or settlements related to the Target Case within the Filing Excerpts.

In conclusion, the LLM followed the task instructions correctly, did not misinterpret or contradict the information provided, and its response aligns with the task requirements. No hallucination is present in the LLM's response.

- **case number**: 2:19-cv-00638
- **case name**: Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al.; Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al.
- **case filing date**: 2019-01-28
- **case count**: United States District Court of Central District of California
</target_case>

LLM Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is "Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al." with case number 2:19-cv-00638. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit 99.3 as "Complaint, Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2:19-cv-00638, filed on January 28, 2019". Therefore, the Target Case is mentioned in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit "settlement" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a "settlement" or "MOU" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will search for an explicit mention of a formal "XXX agreement" that indicates a resolution. However, I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will check if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. However, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will summarize the results as follows:

{
    "supplemental_disclosure": "No",
    "supplemental_disclosure_quote": "Not applicable",
    "reached_agreement": "No",
    "reached_agreement_quote": "Not applicable",
    "note": "Case mentioned but no discussion of supplemental disclosure or agreement."
}
Judge Inference Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The LLM correctly identified that the Target Case, "Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al." with case number 2:19-cv-00638, is mentioned in the Filing Excerpts as Exhibit 99.3. This confirms the existence of a discussion related to the Target Case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The LLM appropriately searched for explicit mentions of supplemental disclosure or planned amendments related to the merger in response to the lawsuit (Target Case). The LLM concluded there was no such mention, which aligns with the Filing Excerpts provided.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The LLM correctly proceeded to examine whether there was mention of an explicit "Settlement Agreement" or "MOU" for the Target Case, finding no such mention in the Filing Excerpts, which aligns with the information given.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The LLM explored the possibility of other formal agreements but correctly noted the absence of any explicit mention of other agreements related to the Target Case, conforming to the excerpts provided.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The LLM checked for any implicit signs of an agreement regarding the Target Case and appropriately noted the absence of such indications in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

The LLM did not identify any agreements to associate with the Target Case, which is consistent with the information reviewed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The LLM accurately summarized its findings, clearly indicating that there was no supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts. The LLM's analysis and results align with the information reviewed:

- No mention of supplemental disclosure was found.
- No explicit or implied agreements related to the Target Case were identified.

The LLM's response is consistent with the information provided in the Filing Excerpts, leading to a correct overall conclusion based on the task instructions.

Excerpts: <filing_excerpts>
(i) | in the United States District Court of Delaware, captioned Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00138-UNA (the "Sabatini Complaint");

(ii) | in California Superior Court of San Luis Obispo County, captioned Schmit v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 19CV-0043 (the "Schmit Complaint");

(iii) | in the United States District Court of Central District of California, captioned Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2:19-cv-00638 (the "Tran Complaint"); and

(iv) | in the Court of Chancery of Delaware, captioned Ryan v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2019-0061 (the "Ryan Complaint," and together with the Sabatini Complaint, Schmit Complaint, and Tran Complaint, the "Complaints")

The Complaints generally allege, among other things, that MINDBODY and the members of its Board of Directors purportedly omitted material information from the Proxy Statement and that the Merger and the process that led to it was procedurally and substantively flawed. The Complaints also allege claims against the members of the Company's Board of Directors and, in the case of the Ryan Complaint, Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC. The Complaints seek, among other things, additional disclosure of facts relating to the Merger and/or injunctive relief. Additional similar lawsuits may be filed in the future. The Company believes that the plaintiffs' allegations in the Complaints lack merit and will vigorously defend against these and any subsequently filed similar actions. If additional similar complaints are filed, absent new or different allegations that are material, the Company will not necessarily disclose such additional filings. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Complaints which are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, 99.3 and 99.4 and incorporated by reference herein.

Additional Information and Where to Find It

In connection with the proposed Merger, MINDBODY has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and furnished to its stockholders a definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A, as well as other relevant documents concerning the proposed transaction. Promptly after filing its definitive proxy statement with the SEC, MINDBODY mailed the definitive proxy statement and a proxy card to each stockholder of MINDBODY entitled to vote at the special meeting relating to the proposed transaction. The proxy statement contains important information about the proposed Merger and related matters. STOCKHOLDERS AND SECURITY HOLDERS OF MINDBODY ARE URGED TO READ THESE MATERIALS (INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO) AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER THAT MINDBODY WILL FILE WITH THE SEC WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT MINDBODY AND THE TRANSACTION. This communication is not a substitute for the proxy statement or for any other document that MINDBODY may file with the SEC and send to its stockholders in connection with the proposed Merger. The proposed Merger will be submitted to MINDBODY's stockholders for their consideration. Before making any voting decision, stockholders of MINDBODY are urged to read the proxy statement regarding the Merger and any other relevant documents filed with the SEC, as well as any amendments or supplements to those documents, because they will contain important information about the proposed Merger.

Stockholders of MINDBODY are able to obtain a free copy of the proxy statement, as well as other filings containing information about MINDBODY and the proposed transaction, without charge, at the SEC's website (http://www.sec.gov).

</target_case>

LLM Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is "Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al." with case number 2:19-cv-00638. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following paragraph:

"(iii) | in the United States District Court of Central District of California, captioned Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2:19-cv-00638 (the "Tran Complaint");"

This confirms that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found the following paragraph:

"The Complaints seek, among other things, additional disclosure of facts relating to the Merger and/or injunctive relief."

However, this paragraph does not explicitly mention that the Company agreed or planned to make supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit. Therefore, I will answer "No" for "supplemental_disclosure".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a "Settlement Agreement" or "MOU" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will proceed to search for an explicit mention of a formal "XXX agreement" that indicates a resolution. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will proceed to check if an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will answer "No" for "reached_agreement".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer "No" for "supplemental_disclosure" and "No" for "reached_agreement".

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```
{
    "supplemental_disclosure": "No",
    "supplemental_disclosure_quote": "Not applicable",
    "reached_agreement": "No",
    "reached_agreement_quote": "Not applicable",
    "note": "Case mentioned but no supplemental disclosure or agreement found."
}
```
Judge Inference Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The LLM correctly identifies that the Target Case, "Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al.," with case number 2:19-cv-00638, is mentioned in the Filing Excerpts. This confirms that there is a discussion of the Target Case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The LLM examines the Filing Excerpts for any explicit mention of supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit. It identifies a sentence stating that the plaintiffs are seeking additional disclosure but correctly observes that there is no explicit mention of the Company agreeing to make such a disclosure. Thus, it concludes "No" for "supplemental_disclosure," which is accurate.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The LLM looks for explicit mentions of a "Settlement Agreement" or "MOU" related to the Target Case but finds none, leading to a preliminary "No" for an explicit settlement.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The LLM searches for any mention of a formal "XXX agreement" that would indicate a resolution. The absence of such a mention leads the LLM to conclude there is no "Other Agreement."

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The LLM identifies no strong implication of an agreement within the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains to the Target Case**

Given that no agreement was identified, the LLM accurately concludes "No" for "reached_agreement."

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The LLM compiles its findings into a JSON object correctly reporting "No" for both "supplemental_disclosure" and "reached_agreement." The response aligns with the task instructions and the information in the excerpts.

Upon thorough analysis, the LLM's response does not contain any hallucinations. Therefore, the LLM has accurately followed the task instructions without contradiction or misinterpretation of the excerpts or task divergence.

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2:19-cv-00638
- **case name**: Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al.; Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al.
- **case filing date**: 2019-01-28
- **case count**: United States District Court of Central District of California
</target_case>

LLM Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is "Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2:19-cv-00638". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the section describing the complaints filed against MINDBODY.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit "settlement" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a "settlement" or "MOU" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal "XXX agreement" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will not proceed with confirming whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer "No" for "supplemental_disclosure" and "No" for "reached_agreement".

Here is the JSON object with the final answer:

{
    "supplemental_disclosure": "No",
    "supplemental_disclosure_quote": "Not applicable",
    "reached_agreement": "No",
    "reached_agreement_quote": "Not applicable",
    "note": "Case not mentioned in the context of supplemental disclosure or agreement."
}
Judge Inference Response: To determine if there is a hallucination in the LLM's response, let's follow the steps outlined in the Task Instructions and compare them to the excerpts.

1. **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**
   - The LLM correctly identifies that there is a discussion of the Target Case, "Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2:19-cv-00638," as it is explicitly mentioned in the Filing Excerpts. This step is followed correctly.

2. **Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**
   - The LLM accurately states that there is no explicit mention in the Filing Excerpts of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the Target Case. The provided text states, "The Company will not necessarily disclose such additional filings," indicating a lack of commitment to supplemental disclosure, especially in response to the lawsuit. Thus, this step is satisfied correctly.

3. **Step 3-6: Search for Explicit Settlement, Other Agreements, Implied Agreements, Confirm Pertinence**
   - The LLM finds no explicit mention of a "settlement," "MOU," or any formal "XXX agreement," and correctly states there's no strong implication of agreement. The excerpts discuss ongoing litigation and mention potential outcomes, but no agreements are explicitly outlined regarding the Target Case. This step is handled accurately.

4. **Step 7: Summarize the Results**
   - The LLM concludes "No" for both "supplemental_disclosure" and "reached_agreement," which aligns with the findings from the previous steps.

The LLM response correctly interprets the information from the Filing Excerpts and adheres to the Task Instructions. There are no contradictions, misinterpretations, or instruction deviations found. Therefore, there is no hallucination in the LLM's response.

</target_case>

LLM Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is "Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al." with case number 2:19-cv-00638. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit 99.3 as "Complaint, Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2:19-cv-00638, filed on January 28, 2019". Therefore, the Target Case is mentioned in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit "settlement" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a "settlement" or "MOU" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will search for an explicit mention of a formal "XXX agreement" that indicates a resolution. However, I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will check if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. However, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will summarize the results as follows:

{
    "supplemental_disclosure": "No",
    "supplemental_disclosure_quote": "Not applicable",
    "reached_agreement": "No",
    "reached_agreement_quote": "Not applicable",
    "note": "Case mentioned but no discussion of supplemental disclosure or agreement."
}
Judge Inference Response: To determine whether the LLM has made a hallucination, let's analyze the response step by step:

1. **Confirm Case Discussion**: The LLM correctly identified the Target Case, "Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al." with case number 2:19-cv-00638, as mentioned in the Filing Excerpts in Exhibit 99.3. Thus, there is a discussion around the Target Case, so this step is accurate.

2. **Search for Supplemental Disclosure**: The LLM reported not finding any mention of supplemental disclosure related to the merger in response to the lawsuit. A review of the provided filing excerpts confirms that there is no mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment connected to the lawsuit. Thus, the LLM correctly answered "No" to this question, and the step is accurately completed.

3. **Search for Explicit Settlement**: The LLM looked for explicit mentions of a "Settlement Agreement" or "MOU" (Memorandum of Understanding) related to the Target Case but found none. This is in line with the information in the filing excerpts, which does not mention any settlement or MOU. This step is thus accurately completed.

4. **Search for other Agreements**: The LLM looked for formal agreements that could resolve the issue but found none. The excerpts do not discuss any formal agreements related to the Target Case. Therefore, this step is correct.

5. **Handle Implied Agreement**: The LLM assessed the excerpts for strong implications of an agreement but found no such indications. This step is accurately completed as no implicit agreements are suggested in the filing excerpts.

6. **Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**: Since no agreements were found, there is no need to confirm association with the target case. This step was adequately reviewed.

7. **Summarize the Results**: Based on the review, the LLM summarized the findings correctly, indicating no supplemental disclosure and no reached agreement.

Upon reviewing these steps, the LLM's response provides an accurate representation of the information provided in the excerpts without any contradictions or misinterpretations. Thus, there appears to be no hallucination in the response. 

Therefore, the final assessment is:

PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO EXPEDITE PURSUANT TO 8 DEL. C. § 220

Plaintiffs Luxor Capital Partners, LP, Luxor Wavefront, LP, Lugard Road Capital Master Fund, LP, and Luxor Capital Partners Offshore Master Fund, LP (collectively "Luxor" or "Plaintiffs"), by and through their undersigned counsel, hereby move for the entry of an order expediting proceedings in this action. The grounds for this motion are as follows:

BACKGROUND

1. Plaintiffs are the beneficial owners of 13.8% of Mindbody's common stock, worth approximately $136,748,815.92 as of market close on December 21, 2018.

2. On December 24, 2018, Mindbody announced that Mindbody, Torreys Parent LLC ("Parent"), and Torreys Merger Sub, Inc. ("Merger Sub") had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which Mindbody would merge into Merger Sub, with Mindbody continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Parent (the "Merger"). Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates of Vista Equity Partners Management LLC ("Vista"). The Company's stockholders will vote on the Merger on February 14, 2019.

3. If the Merger closes, each share of Mindbody common stock will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $36.50 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes (the "Merger Consideration").

4. The Merger is the result of an expedited sale process triggered by the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Richard Stollmeyer's, seemingly unauthorized efforts to shop the Company. Given the hasty sale process, it is no wonder that the Merger Consideration significantly undervalues the Company.

5. When Luxor tried to schedule a meeting with the Company and Vista to discuss its concerns about the sale process and the adequacy of the Merger Consideration, Mr. Stollmeyer gave Luxor the run-around and refused to facilitate such a meeting.

6. Left with no other option, on January 18, 2019, Luxor served Mindbody with a sworn demand for books and records (the "Demand") pursuant to 8 Del. C. § 220.

7. The purposes of the Demand are to investigate: (i) whether the members of the Mindbody Board of Directors (the "Board") breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Merger; (ii) whether the members of the Board were independent with respect to the Merger and any related matters; (iii) the value of Luxor's shares and the fairness of the Merger; (iv) whether to communicate with Mindbody stockholders in advance of the vote on the Merger; (v) the completeness and accuracy of the Company's disclosures regarding the Merger; and (vi) whether to pursue a pre-closing injunction, appraisal, corrective measures, or a post-closing money damages claim in relation to the Merger.

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2019-0070
- **case name**: Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc.
- **case filing date**: 2019-01-30
- **case count**: COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE; Court of Chancery of Delaware
</target_case>

LLM Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is "Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc." with case number 2019-0070. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned, and the provided text appears to be a court filing related to this case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since we did not find any supplemental disclosure, we can proceed to search for an explicit settlement. However, we can also stop here and conclude that there is no supplemental disclosure. We will proceed to search for an explicit settlement to answer the second question.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement between the Company and the plaintiffs.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

There is no implied agreement in the provided Filing Excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Not applicable, as we did not find any agreement.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, we can conclude that:

- The Company did not make or plan to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.
- There is no explicit or implied agreement between the Company and the plaintiffs.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```
{
    "supplemental_disclosure": "No",
    "supplemental_disclosure_quote": "Not applicable",
    "reached_agreement": "No",
    "reached_agreement_quote": "Not applicable",
    "note": "Case discussed but no supplemental disclosure or agreement found."
}
```
Judge Inference Response: To determine whether the LLM has made a hallucination, I will analyze the response based on the defined criteria:

1. **Contradictions and Misinterpretations**:
   - Step 1: The LLM correctly identifies the target case "Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc." as discussed in the filing excerpts. This is accurate since the filing excerpts begin with details and motion associated with the target case.
   - Step 2: The LLM states that there is no mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendments. Upon analysis of the filing excerpts, I note that there is no mention of such disclosures; the excerpts primarily discuss the background of the lawsuit and the issues Luxor Capital Partners have with the merger process.
   - Step 3, 4, 5: No explicit or implied settlement agreement, MOU, or other agreement is mentioned in the excerpts regarding the target case. The LLM's findings that these are not present is correct, as the excerpts only describe the filing and motion for expedited proceedings without any indication of settlement or agreement.
   
2. **Task Instruction Compliance**:
   - The LLM addressed both required questions: about supplemental disclosure ("No") and about an agreement ("No"). It complies with the task instructions correctly, assessing the presence or absence of the supplemental disclosure and agreement based on the excerpts.
   - The formatting and JSON output are consistent with the task's output instructions.

Based on the analysis, the LLM has correctly interpreted the provided excerpts and followed the task instructions. It confirms that there is no discussion of supplemental disclosure or agreements in the excerpts and summarizes this accurately in the JSON object. 

There is no hallucination made by the LLM in its response. The presented information and conclusions are consistent with the provided excerpts.

PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO EXPEDITE PURSUANT TO 8 DEL. C. § 220

Plaintiffs Luxor Capital Partners, LP, Luxor Wavefront, LP, Lugard Road Capital Master Fund, LP, and Luxor Capital Partners Offshore Master Fund, LP (collectively "Luxor" or "Plaintiffs"), by and through their undersigned counsel, hereby move for the entry of an order expediting proceedings in this action. The grounds for this motion are as follows:

BACKGROUND

1. Plaintiffs are the beneficial owners of 13.8% of Mindbody's common stock, worth approximately $136,748,815.92 as of market close on December 21, 2018.

2. On December 24, 2018, Mindbody announced that Mindbody, Torreys Parent LLC ("Parent"), and Torreys Merger Sub, Inc. ("Merger Sub") had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which Mindbody would merge into Merger Sub, with Mindbody continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Parent (the "Merger"). Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates of Vista Equity Partners Management LLC ("Vista"). The Company's stockholders will vote on the Merger on February 14, 2019.

3. If the Merger closes, each share of Mindbody common stock will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $36.50 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes (the "Merger Consideration").

4. The Merger is the result of an expedited sale process triggered by the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Richard Stollmeyer's, seemingly unauthorized efforts to shop the Company. Given the hasty sale process, it is no wonder that the Merger Consideration significantly undervalues the Company.

5. When Luxor tried to schedule a meeting with the Company and Vista to discuss its concerns about the sale process and the adequacy of the Merger Consideration, Mr. Stollmeyer gave Luxor the run-around and refused to facilitate such a meeting.

6. Left with no other option, on January 18, 2019, Luxor served Mindbody with a sworn demand for books and records (the "Demand") pursuant to 8 Del. C. § 220.

7. The purposes of the Demand are to investigate: (i) whether the members of the Mindbody Board of Directors (the "Board") breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Merger; (ii) whether the members of the Board were independent with respect to the Merger and any related matters; (iii) the value of Luxor's shares and the fairness of the Merger; (iv) whether to communicate with Mindbody stockholders in advance of the vote on the Merger; (v) the completeness and accuracy of the Company's disclosures regarding the Merger; and (vi) whether to pursue a pre-closing injunction, appraisal, corrective measures, or a post-closing money damages claim in relation to the Merger.

8. The Company waited five business days and then responded to the Demand with a host of objections (the "Response"). Without conceding anything, it has produced its stockholder list (but not its NOBO list or attendant data), and it has offered to "provide access to certain information that it has reasonably available."

9. On January 29, counsel for the Company and Luxor met and conferred to discuss the scope and timing of the Company's production in response to the Demand. Company counsel confirmed that the Company was only willing to produce certain limited stocklist materials--its list of stockholders of record (produced with the Response) and its NOBO list and attendant data--but none of the substantive materials requested in Section B of the Demand.

LLM Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The provided Filing Excerpts mention the case "Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc." which matches the Target Case. Therefore, we can confirm that there is discussion around the Target Case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

There is no explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. The Company has produced its stockholder list and offered to provide access to certain information, but this is not considered supplemental disclosure.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

There is no explicit mention of a "settlement" or "MOU" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

There is no explicit mention of a formal "XXX agreement" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

There is no strongly implied agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Not applicable as no agreement was found.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, the Company did not make supplemental disclosure or reach an explicit agreement with the Target Case parties.

{
    "supplemental_disclosure": "No",
    "supplemental_disclosure_quote": "Not applicable",
    "reached_agreement": "No",
    "reached_agreement_quote": "Not applicable",
    "note": "Case discussed but no supplemental disclosure or agreement found."
}
Judge Inference Response: Upon analyzing the LLM's response to the provided instructions and excerpts, let's go through the steps to identify any hallucinations:

1. **Confirm Case Discussion**: The LLM correctly identifies the mention of the target case "Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et al. v. MINDBODY, Inc." which is present in the filing excerpts.

2. **Search for Supplemental Disclosure**: The LLM states that there is no explicit mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger. After reviewing the excerpts, this interpretation is correct as there is no discussion of making or planning supplemental disclosure.

3. **Search for Explicit Settlement**: The LLM claims there is no explicit mention of a "settlement" or "MOU" related to the case. This is accurate based on the filing excerpts provided.

4. **Search for Other Agreements**: There is no mention of a formal "XXX agreement" indicating a resolution in the excerpts, which aligns with the LLM's claim.

5. **Handle Implied Agreement**: The LLM concludes there is no strongly implied agreement, which corresponds with the information in the excerpts.

6. **Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**: The lack of a found agreement renders this step not applicable, again aligning with the LLM's determination.

7. **Summarize the Results**: The LLM correctly summarizes that there is no supplemental disclosure or reached agreement concerning the target case in the excerpts provided.

The LLM's response is consistent with the content of the excerpts and follows the task instructions without diverging. There are no contradictions, misinterpretations, or omissions in steps that lead to incorrect conclusions. The LLM did not make any hallucinations in its response.

- **case filing date**: 2019-01-30
- **case count**: COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE; Court of Chancery of Delaware
</target_case>

LLM Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is "Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc." with a case number of 2019-0070 and a filing date of 2019-01-30. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the caption of the case matches the Target Case, and the filing date also matches. Therefore, I confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. However, upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment. The Filing Excerpts only contain general information about the case, such as the caption, date filed, and counsel for the plaintiff. Therefore, I conclude that there is no supplemental disclosure.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement. However, upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any implied agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Not applicable since I did not find any agreement.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my analysis, I conclude that the Company did not make any supplemental disclosure or reach an agreement with the Target Case parties.

{
    "supplemental_disclosure": "No",
    "supplemental_disclosure_quote": "Not applicable",
    "reached_agreement": "No",
    "reached_agreement_quote": "Not applicable",
    "note": "Case not mentioned in the context of supplemental disclosure or agreement."
}
Judge Inference Response: Let's analyze the information provided for any potential hallucination:

1. **Contradictions and Misinterpretations:**
   - The LLM correctly identified that the target case involving Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc., matches the Target Case information provided, as both the case caption and filing date are the same.
   - There is no explicit mention of supplemental disclosure or any agreement made by the defendant company in response to the lawsuit in the excerpts. The LLM has found no evidence related to supplemental disclosures or agreements, which accurately reflects the information in the excerpts.

2. **Divergence from Task Instructions:**
   - The task instructions required checking for explicit mentions of supplemental disclosures or agreements related to the lawsuit in the filing excerpts.
   - The LLM followed this process accurately, confirming the case discussion, searching for mentions of supplemental disclosure, and checking for explicit or implied agreements.

Overall, the LLM's process and findings do not contradict or misinterpret the provided information, nor do they deviate from the task instructions.

Based on the above analysis, the LLM has not made a hallucination.

STATEMENT OF GOOD CAUSE

I am a partner at Abrams & Bayliss LLP and a member in good standing of the Bar of the State of Delaware. With my firm, I am counsel to plaintiffs Luxor Capital Partners, LP, Luxor Wavefront, LP, Lugard Road Capital Master Fund, LP, and Luxor Capital Partners Offshore Master Fund, LP (collectively "Plaintiffs"). We respectfully submit that this action is inappropriate for submission to a Master in the first instance, as it involves a request for expedited consideration of a books and records demand in advance of a stockholder vote scheduled for February 14, 2019 or, in the alternative, in February or March 2019 so that the information requested can be reviewed by Plaintiffs in advance of the deadline to withdraw any appraisal demands (likely to be in mid-April). Therefore, the process of taking and briefing exceptions pursuant to Court of Chancery Rule 144 would unnecessarily delay consideration of this matter.

DEFENDANT'S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF'S

MOTION TO EXPEDITE PURSUANT TO 8 DEL. C. § 220

The Complaint for Inspection of Books and Records Pursuant to 8 Del. C. § 220 filed by Plaintiffs Luxor Capital Partners, LP, Luxor Wavefront, LP, Lugard Road Capital Master Fund, LP, and Luxor Capital Partners Offshore Master Fund, LP (collectively, "Luxor") is filled with innuendo and speculation, and represents just one prong of Luxor's coordinated and premeditated campaign to disrupt--for its sole benefit--the merger between MINDBODY, Inc. ("MINDBODY") and affiliates of Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC ("Vista"). Luxor's motion to expedite a hearing on its Section 220 complaint should be denied for four reasons:

First, Luxor lacks a colorable claim under Section 220. Not only was Luxor's demand grossly overbroad and lacking in any proper purpose, Luxor failed to comply with the requirements of Section 220 by (i) neglecting to submit its demand "under oath" and (ii) neglecting to provide sufficient evidence establishing stockholder status. As Luxor has not properly invoked the statute, the Court should not grant Luxor the privilege of expediting its claims.

Second, Luxor's strategic delay in invoking Section 220 belies the existence of any true emergency. Since MINDBODY announced the merger in December, Luxor (along with the world) has been fully aware of the deal price: $36.50 in cash per share of MINDBODY common stock--a 68% premium over the trading price on the day before announcement. Yet Luxor waited nearly three weeks before articulating its purported concerns about the adequacy of that substantial premium, and Luxor chose to do so by filing a Schedule 13D with the SEC (which its Section 220 complaint and motion fail to mention). Only after Luxor's 13D failed to attract support did Luxor attempt to deploy Section 220. Thus, it was not until nearly four weeks after the merger's announcement that Luxor sent MINDBODY a books-and-records demand. And it was not until January 30, 2019, close to five weeks after the announcement, that Luxor filed this action. Luxor now abruptly seeks a trial "no later than February 8." Pls. Br. ¶ 23. But there is no urgency requiring a Section 220 trial to be held in less than 4 days after the hearing on the motion to expedite--and Luxor has not pointed to any precedent where this Court has ordered a trial on such short notice. Doing so would inconvenience the Court as well as MINDBODY, while advancing no legitimate goal.

- **case number**: 2019-0070
- **case name**: Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc.
- **case filing date**: 2019-01-30
- **case count**: COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE; Court of Chancery of Delaware
</target_case>

LLM Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The provided filing excerpts mention the case "Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc." with case number "2019-0070" in the COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, which matches the target case. Therefore, we can confirm that the target case is discussed in the filing excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

After reviewing the filing excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger in response to the lawsuit. Therefore, I will answer "No" for "supplemental_disclosure".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

I did not find any explicit mention of a "Settlement Agreement" or "MOU" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal "XXX agreement" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since no agreement was found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I will answer "No" for "supplemental_disclosure" and "No" for "reached_agreement".

{
    "supplemental_disclosure": "No",
    "supplemental_disclosure_quote": "Not applicable",
    "reached_agreement": "No",
    "reached_agreement_quote": "Not applicable",
    "note": "Case not mentioned in the context of supplemental disclosure or agreement."
}
Judge Inference Response: To determine whether the LLM has made a hallucination, I will analyze the steps taken in its response, comparing them to the task instructions and the provided excerpts.

**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**
- The LLM correctly identifies that the filing excerpts discuss the case "Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc." with the case number "2019-0070," matching the target case, hence fulfilling the instruction successfully.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**
- The LLM states that there was no explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger in response to the lawsuit. Upon reviewing the excerpts, there is indeed no discussion of supplemental disclosure. The LLM's conclusion of "No" for "supplemental_disclosure" is correct.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**
- The LLM did not find any explicit mention of a "Settlement Agreement" or "MOU" related to the target case, which is consistent with the instructions as the excerpts contain no such information.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**
- Again, the LLM found no mention of a formal "XXX agreement," which matches the absence of any such details in the excerpts.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**
- The LLM did not find any strong implication of an agreement, which is consistent with the excerpts' content.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains to the Target Case**
- Because no agreements were found, this step was appropriately marked as not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**
- The LLM concluded with "No" for both "supplemental_disclosure" and "reached_agreement," consistent with the task's requirements and the analysis of the excerpts.

The LLM followed the task instructions accurately and evaluated the provided excerpts correctly. There is no evidence that the LLM's response contains contradictions, misinterpretations, or any divergence from the explicit or nuanced task instructions. Therefore, the LLM has not made a hallucination in its response.

DEFENDANT'S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF'S

MOTION TO EXPEDITE PURSUANT TO 8 DEL. C. § 220

The Complaint for Inspection of Books and Records Pursuant to 8 Del. C. § 220 filed by Plaintiffs Luxor Capital Partners, LP, Luxor Wavefront, LP, Lugard Road Capital Master Fund, LP, and Luxor Capital Partners Offshore Master Fund, LP (collectively, "Luxor") is filled with innuendo and speculation, and represents just one prong of Luxor's coordinated and premeditated campaign to disrupt--for its sole benefit--the merger between MINDBODY, Inc. ("MINDBODY") and affiliates of Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC ("Vista"). Luxor's motion to expedite a hearing on its Section 220 complaint should be denied for four reasons:

First, Luxor lacks a colorable claim under Section 220. Not only was Luxor's demand grossly overbroad and lacking in any proper purpose, Luxor failed to comply with the requirements of Section 220 by (i) neglecting to submit its demand "under oath" and (ii) neglecting to provide sufficient evidence establishing stockholder status. As Luxor has not properly invoked the statute, the Court should not grant Luxor the privilege of expediting its claims.

Second, Luxor's strategic delay in invoking Section 220 belies the existence of any true emergency. Since MINDBODY announced the merger in December, Luxor (along with the world) has been fully aware of the deal price: $36.50 in cash per share of MINDBODY common stock--a 68% premium over the trading price on the day before announcement. Yet Luxor waited nearly three weeks before articulating its purported concerns about the adequacy of that substantial premium, and Luxor chose to do so by filing a Schedule 13D with the SEC (which its Section 220 complaint and motion fail to mention). Only after Luxor's 13D failed to attract support did Luxor attempt to deploy Section 220. Thus, it was not until nearly four weeks after the merger's announcement that Luxor sent MINDBODY a books-and-records demand. And it was not until January 30, 2019, close to five weeks after the announcement, that Luxor filed this action. Luxor now abruptly seeks a trial "no later than February 8." Pls. Br. ¶ 23. But there is no urgency requiring a Section 220 trial to be held in less than 4 days after the hearing on the motion to expedite--and Luxor has not pointed to any precedent where this Court has ordered a trial on such short notice. Doing so would inconvenience the Court as well as MINDBODY, while advancing no legitimate goal.

Third, Luxor will not suffer any injury, much less irreparably so, without an expedited trial. MINDBODY has already provided Luxor a list of MINDBODY stockholders as of the merger record date, and offered to direct its proxy solicitor to share other available stocklist information (Luxor did not respond). Given MINDBODY's willingness to produce those core stocklist materials to Luxor, expedition is unnecessary. Any remaining dispute can be resolved on a typical Section 220 schedule. See FrontFour Capital Grp. LLC, et al. v. Medley Capital Corp., C.A. No. 2019-0021-KSJM, at 27-29 (Del. Ch. Jan. 16, 2019) (TRANSCRIPT) (prioritizing production of stocklist materials). And, because Luxor's concerns can be addressed adequately after the merger closes (if ever), there is no reason for a trial before the stockholder vote on February 14. Indeed, Luxor implicitly confirms this by requesting, in the alternative, that the Court set a trial as late as March 2019.

Finally, the equities weigh against expedition because Luxor is improperly attempting to use Section 220 to circumvent Rule 34. See Polygon Glob. Opportunities Master Fund v. West Corp., 2006 WL 2947486, at *5 (Del. Ch. Oct. 12, 2006) ("Section 220 is not intended to supplant or circumvent discovery proceedings."). Luxor is secretly coordinating with one of the named plaintiffs in a separate action related to the merger, Ryan Jr. and Friedman v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al., C.A. No. 2019-0061-VCL (the "Ryan/Friedman Action"), filed in this Court on January 29, 2019, which alleges breaches of fiduciary duty by MINDBODY's directors. In particular, on information and belief, Luxor principal Douglas Friedman is an immediate family member of Donald Friedman, a named plaintiff in the Ryan/Friedman Action. On information and belief, the Friedmans have coordinated these actions without disclosing their relationship to MINDBODY or this Court. Luxor's shadow participation in the Ryan/Friedman Action--where the breach of fiduciary duty claims that Luxor purports to be interested in investigating have already been asserted--undermines its claimed need for expedited proceedings here. It also indicates that this action is little more than a fishing expedition designed to bolster the Ryan/Friedman Action.

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2019-0070
- **case name**: Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc.

</target_case>

LLM Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The provided filing excerpts discuss the case "Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc." with case number 2019-0070, which matches the target case. Therefore, we can confirm that the filing excerpts are related to the target case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

After reviewing the filing excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since we did not find any supplemental disclosure, we can proceed to search for an explicit settlement. However, after reviewing the filing excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a "settlement" or "MOU" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal "XXX agreement" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Not applicable since we did not find any agreement.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the defendant company did not make any supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit, and there is no indication of a settlement or agreement.

{
    "supplemental_disclosure": "No",
    "supplemental_disclosure_quote": "Not applicable",
    "reached_agreement": "No",
    "reached_agreement_quote": "Not applicable",
    "note": "Case not mentioned in the context of supplemental disclosure or agreement."
}
Judge Inference Response: To determine whether the LLM's response contains a hallucination, we must analyze the response based on the instructions and the information provided in the filing excerpts.

1. **Confirm Case Discussion**: The filing excerpts clearly mention the target case "Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc." with the correct case number 2019-0070. The LLM correctly identified this, so the response does not contain any misinterpretation at this step.

2. **Search for Supplemental Disclosure**: The filing excerpts need to explicitly mention supplemental disclosure related to the lawsuit. The LLM did not find any such mention, which is correct because no explicit mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment can be identified in the provided excerpts.

3. **Search for Explicit Settlement**: The excerpts need to explicitly mention a settlement agreement, MOU, or implied agreement related to the case. The LLM searched for these and found no references, which aligns with the content of the excerpts.

4. **Search for Other Agreements**: No explicit mention of any form of XXX agreement or resolution is found in the filing excerpts, which is correctly identified by the LLM. 

5. **Handle Implied Agreement**: The LLM did not find any strong implication of an agreement, and this is consistent with the excerpts provided.

6. **Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**: Not applicable, because no agreement was identified by the LLM.

7. **Summarize the Results**: The LLM concluded with no supplemental disclosure or settlements/agreement. The filing excerpts support this conclusion.

Based on the analysis above, the LLM's response did not contradict or misinterpret the provided excerpts, and it followed the task instructions closely. Therefore, the claim of a hallucination in the LLM's response is unfounded.

The Complaint for Inspection of Books and Records Pursuant to 8 Del.

- **case number**: 2019-0070
- **case name**: Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc.
- **case filing date**: 2019-01-30
- **case count**: COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE; Court of Chancery of Delaware
</target_case>

LLM Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is "Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc." with case number 2019-0070. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the document, specifically in the caption of the court filing.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement that suggests a resolution to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any mention of a formal agreement that indicates a resolution to the case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Not applicable since I did not find any agreement.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my review of the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or an agreement that suggests a resolution to the case.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```
{
    "supplemental_disclosure": "No",
    "supplemental_disclosure_quote": "Not applicable",
    "reached_agreement": "No",
    "reached_agreement_quote": "Not applicable",
    "note": "Case not mentioned in the context of supplemental disclosure or agreement."
}
```
Judge Inference Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The LLM correctly identified the discussion around the Target Case "Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc." in the provided Filing Excerpts. The case number matches, so the discussions about the Target Case are confirmed.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The LLM did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit. The Filing Excerpts provided do not contain such information, so the LLM's response is correct here.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The LLM searched for explicit mentions of a settlement agreement, MOU, or other types of agreements but found none in the Filing Excerpts. This step was correctly executed based on the information provided.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The LLM correctly did not find any mention of a formal agreement that indicates a resolution to the case beyond the search for a settlement or MOU in the provided excerpts.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The LLM did not find any strong implication of an agreement. The Filing Excerpts do not suggest any implied agreements.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains to the Target Case**

Since there was no agreement found, this step is indeed not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The LLM correctly summarized that there was no mention of supplemental disclosure or an agreement that suggests a resolution to the case. The final JSON output correctly encapsulates this conclusion.

Based on the analysis, the LLM has not made a hallucination as it appeared to correctly follow the task instructions and interpret the provided Filing Excerpts.

No. 2019-0061-VCL (the "Ryan/Friedman Action"), filed in this Court on January 29, 2019, which alleges breaches of fiduciary duty by MINDBODY's directors. In particular, on information and belief, Luxor principal Douglas Friedman is an immediate family member of Donald Friedman, a named plaintiff in the Ryan/Friedman Action. On information and belief, the Friedmans have coordinated these actions without disclosing their relationship to MINDBODY or this Court. Luxor's shadow participation in the Ryan/Friedman Action--where the breach of fiduciary duty claims that Luxor purports to be interested in investigating have already been asserted--undermines its claimed need for expedited proceedings here. It also indicates that this action is little more than a fishing expedition designed to bolster the Ryan/Friedman Action.

Luxor's motion to expedite should be denied.

BACKGROUND

A. | Vista Agrees to Acquire MINDBODY and MINDBODY Plans a Go-Shop.

On December 24, 2018, MINDBODY and Vista announced a merger agreement at $36.50 per share, 68% above the closing price of MINDBODY's common stock on the trading day before the merger was announced and 42% above the 30-day volume weighted average price. Compl. ¶ 2. This represents the second-highest revenue multiple ever paid by a private equity firm for a public software-as-a-service company and the third highest multiple for any public software asset. See Compl. Ex. B at 1-2. The merger is subject to approval by MINDBODY shareholders, regulatory review, and other closing conditions. MINDBODY's Board of Directors, who collectively own tens of thousands of shares of MINDBODY common stock and are thus aligned with the interests of MINDBODY'S stockholders, unanimously approved the transaction. See Compl. Ex. B. at 2. The merger agreement provided a 30-day go-shop period. Compl. ¶ 45.

B. | Luxor Publicly Criticizes the Merger in a Detailed Schedule 13D Filing.

On January 9, 2019, MINDBODY filed a preliminary proxy statement disclosing the process leading to the agreement with Vista. Compl. ¶ 77. The next day, Luxor filed a Schedule 13D with the SEC. Ex. 1, Luxor Schedule 13D (Jan. 10, 2019). After declaring the size of its MINDBODY investments--$140 million in common stock and $130 million in convertible notes--Luxor proclaimed that it "believe[d] that the Proposed Merger significantly undervalue[d] the Shares" and that it intended to discuss the merger with MINDBODY's stockholders, board of directors, and management.1 Id.

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2019-0070
- **case name**: Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc.
- **case filing date**: 2019-01-30
- **case count**: COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE; Court of Chancery of Delaware
</target_case>

LLM Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is "Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc." with case number 2019-0070. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the text. The case is referenced as "Luxor's motion to expedite a hearing on its Section 220 complaint" and "Luxor's Section 220 complaint and motion fail to mention" in the DEFENDANT'S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO EXPEDITE PURSUANT TO 8 DEL. C. § 220. Therefore, I can confirm that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. However, I found that "MINDBODY has already provided Luxor a list of MINDBODY stockholders as of the merger record date, and offered to direct its proxy solicitor to share other available stocklist information (Luxor did not respond)." This statement suggests that MINDBODY has provided some information to Luxor, but it is not clear if this is a supplemental disclosure or amendment. Therefore, I will answer "No" for "supplemental_disclosure".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit "settlement" for the Target Case. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a "settlement" or "Settlement Agreement" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal "XXX agreement" that indicates a resolution. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal "XXX agreement" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement or settlement, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I will answer "No" for "supplemental_disclosure" and "No" for "reached_agreement".

{
    "supplemental_disclosure": "No",
    "supplemental_disclosure_quote": "Not applicable",
    "reached_agreement": "No",
    "reached_agreement_quote": "Not applicable",
    "note": "Case discussed but no supplemental disclosure or agreement found."
}
Judge Inference Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

I am tasked to determine if there is discussion around the Target Case, which is "Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc." with case number 2019-0070. The Filing Excerpts do mention the Target Case indirectly through references to Luxor's actions relating to Section 220, so the case is discussed.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

Next, I must search for any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, specifically in response to the lawsuit. The Filing Excerpts mention MINDBODY providing a list of stockholders to Luxor and offering further information. However, this does not qualify as a "supplemental disclosure" in response to a lawsuit, as it lacks the formal qualities and explicit tie to any requirement for disclosure or amendment stemming from the litigation. Therefore, the answer for "supplemental_disclosure" is "No".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

I must look for any indication of an explicit "settlement" pertaining to the Target Case, usually indicated by the mention of "Settlement Agreement." The Filing Excerpts do not contain any mention of a settlement or settlement agreement.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**

Next, I check for any formal "XXX agreement" which could indicate resolution not termed as a Settlement Agreement or MOU. There is no discussion of a formal agreement of this nature in the excerpts.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

Finally, I need to determine if there is a strong implication of an agreement without explicit use of terminology. No strong implication of any implicit agreement is present in the excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**

Since there are no agreements found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Summarizing the results, there is no supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit nor any agreement with the Target Case parties identified. Therefore, my answers are "No" for both "supplemental_disclosure" and "reached_agreement".

```json
{
    "supplemental_disclosure": "No",
    "supplemental_disclosure_quote": "Not applicable",
    "reached_agreement": "No",
    "reached_agreement_quote": "Not applicable",
    "note": "Case discussed but no supplemental disclosure or agreement found."
}
```

The LLM's response effectively follows the instructions and correctly answers the questions based on the provided excerpts, with accurate justification and citations. There is no hallucination because it correctly identifies no evidence of supplemental disclosure or agreements.

PLAINTIFFS' REPLY IN FURTHER

SUPPORT OF THEIR MOTION TO EXPEDITE

1. In its opposition, Mindbody1 contends that the Demand violates Section 220's form and manner requirements, attacks Luxor for waiting four weeks after the Merger announcement to demand books and records, complains of the burden associated with a prompt trial, urges that Luxor's concerns can be addressed post-closing, and alleges that Luxor is colluding with the plaintiffs in a plenary action. All of these arguments fail.

1 | Undefined capitalized terms have the meanings ascribed to them in Luxor's Verified Complaint (the "Complaint") (Dkt. 1). All exhibits references are to exhibits to the Complaint.

2. First, the Demand complies with Section 220's form and manner requirements. Moreover, Mindbody raised its form and manner objections for the first time in the opposition and thereby waived them.

3. Second, Mindbody cannot blame Luxor for the time crunch. Luxor acted diligently and sought relief within the time constraints imposed by Mindbody's breakneck transaction schedule.

4. Third, Mindbody's claim that post-closing relief is available ignores the reality that defendants in any post-closing fiduciary duty suit will argue that Luxor should have sought pre-closing relief and that it lacks standing to pursue certain claims post-closing. By refusing to produce even the most basic information, Mindbody is preventing Luxor from complying with the Delaware Supreme Court's directive to use tools at hand to conduct pre-suit investigations.

5. Fourth, Mindbody's objection to the Demand's scope is unavailing. Mindbody refused to negotiate the scope of any substantive production. It cannot now claim that overbreadth defeats expedition.

6. The Court should set a trial for as soon as possible.

LLM Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The provided filing excerpts appear to be related to the Target Case, as the case number (2019-0070) and case name (Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc.) match the information provided in the Target Case section. The filing excerpts also mention the COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, which matches the court information provided in the Target Case section. Therefore, it is confirmed that the filing excerpts discuss the Target Case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

After reviewing the filing excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company (MINDBODY, Inc.) agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger in response to the lawsuit. Therefore, I will answer "No" for "supplemental_disclosure".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a "Settlement Agreement" or "MOU" (memorandum of understanding) related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal "XXX agreement" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will answer "No" for "reached_agreement".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my review of the filing excerpts, I did not find any evidence of supplemental disclosure or an agreement related to the Target Case.

{
    "supplemental_disclosure": "No",
    "supplemental_disclosure_quote": "Not applicable",
    "reached_agreement": "No",
    "reached_agreement_quote": "Not applicable",
    "note": "Case discussed but no supplemental disclosure or agreement found."
}
Judge Inference Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The LLM correctly identifies the connection between the filing excerpts and the Target Case. The excerpts mention the case number (2019-0070) and case name (Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et al. v. MINDBODY, Inc.), which match the Target Case provided. The filing is also situated within the "COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE," aligning with the Target Case details.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The LLM concludes that there is no explicit mention of Mindbody, Inc. agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendments in response to the lawsuit. The provided excerpts focus on legal arguments rather than any disclosure actions, supporting the LLM's conclusion of "No" for "supplemental_disclosure."

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The LLM accurately states that it found no explicit mention of a "Settlement Agreement" or "MOU" within the provided excerpts related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

Similarly, the LLM correctly notes the absence of any explicit mention of a formal "XXX agreement" indicating a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

No strong implication of an agreement is found, which is acknowledged by the LLM.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since no agreement was found, confirming its pertinence to the Target Case is unnecessary, leading to the conclusion of "No" for "reached_agreement."

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The LLM's summary aligns with its analysis, reflecting the absence of evidence for both supplemental disclosure and agreement related to the Target Case.

Upon reviewing the above steps and the content of the filing excerpts, the LLM response does not contain any contradictions or misinterpretations and follows the task instructions correctly. The response answers the questions posed accurately based on the content provided.

Thus, the LLM has not made a hallucination in its response.

LLM Response: **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is "Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc." with case number 2019-0070. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned, specifically in the court order granting the motion to expedite. The case name and number match the Target Case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

There is no implied agreement suggested in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Not applicable since no agreement was found.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that there is no supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

{
    "supplemental_disclosure": "No",
    "supplemental_disclosure_quote": "Not applicable",
    "reached_agreement": "No",
    "reached_agreement_quote": "Not applicable",
    "note": "Case not mentioned in the context of supplemental disclosure or agreement."
}
Judge Inference Response: The task requires analyzing the excerpts to determine if there is evidence of supplemental disclosure or agreements related to the specific target case. Here’s the detailed breakdown:

1. **Confirm Case Discussion**: The provided filing excerpts do discuss the Target Case, "Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et al. v. MINDBODY, Inc." with the correct case number 2019-0070, as it is matched in the court order granting the motion to expedite. LLM correctly identifies the case discussion.

2. **Search for Supplemental Disclosure**: The task requires identifying any mention of the company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment. There's no mention of supplemental disclosure in the provided excerpts, which the LLM correctly identifies.

3. **Search for Explicit Settlement**: The LLM correctly notes that there is no mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or other types of agreements related to the Target Case in the excerpts.

4. **Search for other Agreements**: There is no indication of any agreement, formal or otherwise, in the excerpts, which the LLM acknowledges correctly.

5. **Handle Implied Agreement**: There is no implied agreement evident, which the LLM correctly concludes.

6. **Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**: Since no agreement is found, this step is not applicable.

7. **Summarize the Results**: The LLM accurately summarizes that there is no supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case in the excerpts.

The LLM correctly follows the task instructions, accurately determining the absence of supplemental disclosure and agreements. There is no contradictory or misinterpreted information presented in the LLM's response.

Therefore, the LLM has not made a hallucination.

Plaintiff Sunil Kumar ("Plaintiff"), by his undersigned attorneys, for his complaint against defendants, alleges upon personal knowledge with respect to himself, and upon information and belief based upon, inter alia, the investigation of counsel as to all other allegations herein, as follows:

NATURE OF THE ACTION

1. This is a class action brought on behalf of the public stockholders of MINDBODY, Inc. ("MINDBODY" or the "Company") against MINDBODY and its Board of Directors (the "Board" or the "Individual Defendants") for their violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), 15 U.S.C. §§ 78n(a), 78t(a), and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") Rule 14a-9, 17 C.F.R. 240.14a-9, and to enjoin the vote on a proposed transaction, pursuant to which MINDBODY will be acquired by affiliates of Vista Equity Partners through Torreys Parent, LLC ("Parent") and Parent's wholly owned subsidiary Torreys Merger Sub, Inc. ("Merger Sub" and together with Parent and the affiliates of Vista Equity Partners, "Vista") (the "Proposed Transaction").

2. On December 24, 2018, MINDBODY issued a press release announcing it had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") to sell MINDBODY to Vista for $36.50 in cash for each share of MINDBODY common stock held (the "Merger Consideration"). The Proposed Transaction is valued at approximately $1.9 billion.

3. On January 23, 2019, MINDBODY filed a Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A (the "Proxy Statement") with the SEC. The Proxy Statement, which recommends that MINDBODY stockholders vote in favor of the Proposed Transaction, omits or misrepresents material information concerning, among other things: (i) MINDBODY insiders' potential conflicts of interest and the background process leading to the Proposed Transaction; and (ii) the data and inputs underlying the financial valuation analyses that support the fairness opinion provided by the Company's financial advisor, Qatalyst Partners LP ("Qatalyst"). The failure to adequately disclose such material information constitutes a violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") as MINDBODY stockholders need such information in order to cast a fully-informed vote or seek appraisal in connection with the Proposed Transaction.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over all claims asserted herein for violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78aa, and 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction).

5. This Court has jurisdiction over defendants because each defendant is either a corporation that conducts business in and maintains operations within this District, or is an individual who has sufficient minimum contacts with this District so as to render the exercise of jurisdiction by this Court permissible under traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.

6. Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because Plaintiff's claims arose in this District, where a substantial portion of the conduct took place, where most of the documents are electronically stored, and where the evidence exists. MINDBODY is incorporated in Delaware and is headquartered in this District. Moreover, each of the Individual Defendants, as Company officers or directors, either resides in this District or has extensive contacts within this District.

Judge Inference Response: To determine whether the LLM's response contains a hallucination, we need to evaluate the steps based on the provided excerpts and instructions.

1. **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**
   - The Target Case, Kumar v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., is mentioned in the filing excerpts. The LLM correctly identified that the complaint was related to the Proposed Transaction.

2. **Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**
   - The filing excerpts do not contain any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment by MINDBODY. The LLM correctly stated that there is no mention of such disclosure.

3. **Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**
   - The filing excerpts do not mention any "settlement" or "MOU" concerning the case. The LLM correctly identified that there is no mention of such agreements.

4. **Step 4: Search for other Agreements**
   - There is no evidence in the excerpts indicating any formal agreement resolving the case. The LLM's statement that there is no mention of such agreement is accurate based on the excerpts.

5. **Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**
   - There is no implied agreement found in the excerpts. The LLM's interpretation that there is no strong implication of an agreement is correct.

6. **Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains to the Target Case**
   - Since no agreement was identified, this step is not applicable.

Overall, the LLM followed the task instructions carefully and did not make any contradictions or misinterpretations. The response does not deviate from the provided instructions. Each step was justified based on the available information within the filing excerpts.

Therefore, the LLM did not make a hallucination.

Judge Inference Response: Upon evaluating the LLM’s response, I will determine the accuracy of the analysis based on the provided excerpts and task instructions:

**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

- The LLM correctly identifies that the filing excerpts include a discussion of a case involving Sunil Kumar against MINDBODY, which matches the Target Case. Therefore, the task of confirming the presence of the Target Case in the discussion is correctly completed.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

- The LLM states there is no mention of the Company making a supplemental disclosure or amendment regarding the merger. After reviewing the filing excerpts, there is indeed no evidence of any supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger in response to the lawsuit. Thus, this analysis is accurate.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

- The LLM claims there is no mention of a "settlement" or "MOU" related to the case in the excerpts, which is correct as the provided excerpts do not mention any explicit settlement agreement or MOU.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**

- The LLM finds no mention of a formal agreement type indicating a resolution, which is consistent with the content of the excerpts, as they contain no such references.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

- The LLM states there is no strongly implied agreement, which aligns with the absence of any such implication in the excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**

- This step is marked as not applicable by the LLM, as no agreements were discussed in the excerpts regarding the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

- The LLM summarizes the lack of supplemental disclosures and agreements correctly. However, the note states: "Case not mentioned in the context of supplemental disclosure or agreement." This seems accurate, given that the excerpts did not contain discussion around the supplemental disclosure or agreements in any form.

Based on the critical review of the excerpts and LLM's response, no hallucination is detected. The response does not contradict the excerpts and follows the task instructions correctly.

Hence, the LLM has not made a hallucination based on the provided details.

**Final Decision:** <answer>False</answer>
