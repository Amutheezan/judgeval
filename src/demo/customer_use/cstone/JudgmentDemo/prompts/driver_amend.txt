The following five questions are related. In Certificate of Incorporation, relevant language is usually found under the article called "Amendments" or "Amendments of Certificate of Incorporation" or alike. The relevant article might not have title header but number header ("TWELFTH", "XII", or any other number). Typically however, this will be one of the last three articles in the document.

Q1:
"Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a supermajority of stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation?

This is a ""Yes"" or ""No"" question. Code ""Yes"" if Certificate of Incorporation amendments require more than a majority of stockholders to amend Certificate of Incorporation. Typical supermajority requires two-thirds, or sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%), of the voting power to amend bylaws. Less common supermajority options are 65%, 75%, 80%, or 85%. Stockholders can be referred to as shareholders or holders.  Example wording of the supermajority provision to amend the Certificate of Incorporation is ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or to adopt any provision as part of this Certificate."" If the supermajority is only required for a subset of articles, still code ""Yes"". If the supermajority is only required in certain circumstances, e.g. If an unqualified majority of stockholders is sufficient to amend the Certificate of Incorporation, code ""No"". Example wording for an unqualified majority (coded ""No"") would be ""Except as otherwise required by this Certificate or by law, whenever any vote of the holders of capital stock of the Corporation is required to amend or repeal any provision of this Certificate, such amendment or repeal shall require the affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote on such amendment or repeal, and the affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote thereon as a class, at a duly constituted meeting of stockholders called expressly for such purpose."" If there is no information on the amendments, code ""NA"". Otherwise, code ""Unsure"". "

Q2:
"If yes, what percentage?

This variable includes quantitative output (% number, rounded if needed). If the answer to the previous question (""Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a supermajority of stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation?"") is ""Yes"", specify the percantage of shareholder voting power required to amend the Certificate of Incorporation. Typical supermajoirty requires sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the voting power to amend bylaws. Less common supermajority options are 65%, 75%, 80%, or 85%.  An example supermajority wording can be (coded as ""66.67%""): ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or to adopt any provision as part of this Certificate"" If there is No supermajority, return ""50%"" if provision specifies that majority of shareholders can amend the certificate of incorporation, for example: ""Except as otherwise required by this Certificate or by law, whenever any vote of the holders of capital stock of the Corporation is required to amend or repeal any provision of this Certificate, such amendment or repeal shall require the affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote on such amendment or repeal, and the affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote thereon as a class, at a duly constituted meeting of stockholders called expressly for such purpose."" If percentage is not specified or if amendment provision is missing, code ""NA"". Otherwise, code ""Unsure""."
======================
Q3:
"If no, what is the language?

This variable requires textual output. If the answer to the first question in the block (""Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a supermajority of stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation?"") is ""No"", copy the language that was used to support ""No"". For example: ""Except as otherwise required by this Certificate or by law, whenever any vote of the holders of capital stock of the Corporation is required to amend or repeal any provision of this Certificate, such amendment or repeal shall require the affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote on such amendment or repeal, and the affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote thereon as a class, at a duly constituted meeting of stockholders called expressly for such purpose."" If amendment provision is missing, code ""NA"". Otherwise, code ""Unsure""."
