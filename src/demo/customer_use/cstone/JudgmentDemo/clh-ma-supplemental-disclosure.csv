NOBLAW39638738,"Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al.",2019-06-18,2019CV30601,"District Court of Boulder County, Colorado",000155837019010195_zayo-20190930x10qf8d03d.htm_chunk_197,"<filing_excerpts>
The Company accrues for losses related to contingencies when a loss from such claims is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss from a claim is probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company reviews and evaluates its litigation and regulatory matters in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If the Company determines an unfavorable outcome is not probable or the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company does not accrue for a potential litigation loss. In those situations, the Company discloses an estimate or range of the reasonably possible losses, if such estimates can be made.

At this time, the Company does not believe that it is possible to estimate the reasonably possible losses or a range of reasonably possible losses related to the matters described below.

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.), Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.), and Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.); one action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.); and one action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. The complaints generally alleged, among other things, that the Company and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement or that the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the proxy statement violated federal securities laws, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures, as of September 30, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot.

Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-TMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0589-TMR (July 31, 2019). The Company intends to vigorously defend against these actions.

(13) REVENUE AND CONTRACT COSTS

Nature of the Company's Products and Offerings

Refer to the Revenue Recognition section of Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 15 - Revenue and Contract Costs in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019 for further information regarding our application of ASC 606, including practical expedients and judgments applied in determining the amounts and timing of revenue from contracts with customers.

Reconciliation of Total Revenue to Revenue from Contracts with Customers

The following table provides the amount of revenue that is not subject to ASC 606, but is instead governed by other accounting standards:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2019CV30601

- **case filing date**: 2019-06-18
- **case count**: District Court of Boulder County, Colorado

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following sentence:

""One action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601.""

This confirms that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following sentence:

""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019.""

This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosures, but it does not explicitly state that it was in response to the lawsuit. However, the sentence that follows provides more context:

""In light of those supplemental disclosures, as of September 30, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot.""

This suggests that the supplemental disclosures were related to the lawsuits, including the Target Case. Therefore, I conclude that the Company made supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement, I do not need to confirm whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my analysis, I conclude that the Company made supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuit, but there is no explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```
{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""Yes"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019."",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",

ITEM 1. | LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the ordinary course of business, we are from time to time party to various litigation matters that we believe are incidental to the operation of our business. We record an appropriate provision when the occurrence of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We cannot estimate with certainty our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to any such pending litigation matters and it is possible one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on us. However, we believe that the outcome of such pending litigation matters will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, our consolidated financial condition or our liquidity.

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v.

Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.); one action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.); and one action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. The complaints generally alleged, among other things, that the Company and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement or that the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the proxy statement violated federal securities laws, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al."" with case number 2019CV30601. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the section ""ITEM 1. | LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"" as one of the actions filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019, as stated in the section ""ITEM 1. | LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"". The supplemental disclosures were made in response to the complaints filed against the Company, including the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case, I do not need to confirm whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I conclude that the Company made supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuit, including the Target Case. However, I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

In the normal course of business, the Company is party to various outstanding legal proceedings, asserted and unasserted claims, and disputes. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters, both asserted and unasserted, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

The Company accrues for losses related to contingencies when a loss from such claims is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss from a claim is probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company reviews and evaluates its litigation and regulatory matters in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If the Company determines an unfavorable outcome is not probable or the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company does not accrue for a potential litigation loss. In those situations, the Company discloses an estimate or range of the reasonably possible losses, if such estimates can be made. At this time, the Company does not believe that it is possible to estimate the reasonably possible losses or a range of reasonably possible losses related to the matters described below.

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.), Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.), and Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.); one action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.); and one action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. The complaints generally alleged, among other things, that the Company and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement or that the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the proxy statement violated federal securities laws, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures, during the six months ended December 31, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot. Plaintiffs in those actions have reserved the right to seek an award for attorneys' fees for causing the filing of the supplemental disclosures.

Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-TMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0589-TMR (July 31, 2019). Three complaints were treated as one consolidated action, and on October 8, 2019, the parties executed a Settlement and Confidentiality Agreement whereby the Company agreed to produce certain books and records to the plaintiffs in full satisfaction and dismissal of the consolidated action. The parties are meeting and conferring to resolve any outstanding questions regarding production, and plaintiffs are obligated to dismiss their cases once that process concludes.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following paragraph:

""One action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601.""

This confirms that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following paragraph:

""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures, during the six months ended December 31, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot.""

This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuits, including the Target Case. The supplemental disclosure is specifically mentioned to be in response to the lawsuits, and the Target Case is one of the lawsuits mentioned.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case. However, I found that the complaints, including the Target Case, were voluntarily dismissed as moot after the Company issued supplemental disclosures.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

Since there is no explicit ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"", the next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

Although there is no explicit agreement, the fact that the complaints were voluntarily dismissed as moot after the Company issued supplemental disclosures implies that the parties may have reached an agreement. However, this is not a strong implication, and I will err on the side of caution.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since there is no explicit agreement, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Company made supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuits, including the Target Case. However, I did not find any explicit agreement related to the Target Case.

ITEM 1. | LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the ordinary course of business, we are from time to time party to various litigation matters that we believe are incidental to the operation of our business. We record an appropriate provision when the occurrence of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We cannot estimate with certainty our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to any such pending litigation matters and it is possible one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on us. However, we believe that the outcome of such pending litigation matters will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, our consolidated financial condition or our liquidity.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019 sets forth information relating to other important risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Those risk factors, in addition to the other information set forth in this report, continue to be relevant to an understanding of our business, financial condition and operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2019. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report discussed above, except as stated below.

Our business depends on the demand for our bandwidth infrastructure, driven primarily by demand for data, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. Additionally, a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our customers may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our bandwidth infrastructure or services).

Our customers' demand for our bandwidth infrastructure depends on the demand for data. The willingness of our customers to utilize our bandwidth infrastructure, or renew or extend existing contracts on our bandwidth infrastructure, is affected by numerous factors, including:

ยท | consumers' and organizations' demand for data;

ยท | availability or capacity of our bandwidth infrastructure or associated land interests;

ยท | location of our bandwidth infrastructure;

ยท | financial condition of our customers, including their profitability and availability or cost of capital;

LITIGATION RELATED TO THE MERGER

Following the filing of the Definitive Proxy Statement, on May 9, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed putative class action lawsuits against the Company and members of the Board (other than Mr. Serock) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Bartholomew v.

AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04178 (S.D.N.Y.) and Myhre v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04175 (S.D.N.Y.), respectively. The complaints are substantially identical and allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, the ""Exchange Act"") because the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on April 9, 2018 (the ""Preliminary Proxy Statement"") allegedly omitted material information with respect to the merger, thus rendering the Preliminary Proxy Statement false and misleading. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger and costs of the applicable action, including reasonable allowance for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 15, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, captioned Shust v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01129 (N.D. Ohio). On May 18, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.). On May 21, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company, members of the Board, Parent, Merger Sub and Stone Point in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Rabinowitz v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04484 (S.D.N.Y.). Similar to the complaints described above, the complaints allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the Definitive Proxy Statement, in the case of the Shust complaint and the Rabinowitz complaint, and the Preliminary Proxy Statement, in the case of the Raul complaint, omitted or misrepresented material information concerning the merger. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger unless additional disclosure is provided and costs of the applicable action, including for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 21, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed a complaint against the Company and certain of its directors in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. Zyskind, et al., Case No. 2018-0358 (Del. Ch.). The complaint alleges that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties to the Company and seeks, among other things, a declaration that the merger was not entirely fair and an order rescinding the merger or granting an award of rescissory damages, interest and expenses, including reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees and costs.

SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES

The Company believes that no further disclosure is required to supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement under applicable laws; however, to avoid the risk that the litigations described above may delay or otherwise adversely affect the consummation of the merger and to minimize the expense of defending such actions, the Company wishes to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger, all of which are set forth below, in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above. Nothing in this Supplement shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the complaints described above that any additional disclosure was or is required. The information contained in this Supplement is incorporated by reference into the Definitive Proxy Statement. To the extent that information in this Supplement differs from or updates information contained in the Definitive Proxy Statement, the information in this Supplement shall supersede or supplement the information in the Definitive Proxy Statement. Capitalized terms used herein, but not otherwise defined, shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Definitive Proxy Statement. Unless stated otherwise, new text is bolded and underlined to highlight the supplemental information being provided to you and deleted text is bolded and denoted by a strike-through.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee; Recommendation of the Board of Directors; Fairness of the Merger"" on page 5 as follows:

Based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, as well as on the basis of the other factors described below (including, among other factors, the financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Special Committee by Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. (""Deutsche Bank"")), which the Board adopted as its own, the Board unanimously resolved on behalf of the Company that the Merger Agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were fair, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and the Unaffiliated Stockholders, approved the Merger Agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby and recommended that the stockholders of the Company vote ""FOR"" the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Background of the Merger"" on page 21 as follows:

From time to time, during the two year period preceding the execution of the Merger Agreement, representatives of the Company have held discussions with representatives of various strategic and financial sponsor parties regarding potential strategic transactions involving the Company, including discussions in November and December 2017 related to a potential going-private transaction with five other parties. None of the discussions with those five other parties in November and December 2017 developed beyond a preliminary nature or resulted in any proposal. Except as discussed below or as previously disclosed in the Company's filings with the SEC, none of those discussions progressed beyond the preliminary phase. In connection with those discussions, the Company has entered into confidentiality and standstill agreements with several parties, including three of the five parties referenced above. As of the date of this proxy statement, pursuant to action taken by the Special Committee under the Merger Agreement, none of the parties with whom the Company has entered into confidentiality and standstill agreements is prohibited by the terms of such agreements from making offers to acquire the Company.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Background of the Merger"" on page 22 as follows:

In the context of Stone Point's due diligence investigation, and inquiries from and preliminary discussions with other financial sponsor parties in November and December 2017 regarding a potential going-private referred to above, on December 7, 2017, the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family amended its Schedule 13D to state that the members of the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family were considering plans and proposals with respect to their investments in the Company that could result in any of the events described in Item 4 of Schedule 13D.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Myhre v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04175 (S.D.N.Y.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the section ""LITIGATION RELATED TO THE MERGER"". Therefore, the Target Case is discussed in the filing.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company made supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain allegations raised in the complaints, including the Target Case. The relevant quote is:

""The Company believes that no further disclosure is required to supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement under applicable laws; however, to avoid the risk that the litigations described above may delay or otherwise adversely affect the consummation of the merger and to minimize the expense of defending such actions, the Company wishes to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger, all of which are set forth below, in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above.""

This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuit, including the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

Since there is no explicit ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"", the next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

Since there is no explicit agreement, the next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since there is no agreement found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, the Company made supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to the lawsuit, including the Target Case. However, there is no explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

The complaints are substantially identical and allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, the ""Exchange Act"") because the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on April 9, 2018 (the ""Preliminary Proxy Statement"") allegedly omitted material information with respect to the merger, thus rendering the Preliminary Proxy Statement false and misleading. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger and costs of the applicable action, including reasonable allowance for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 15, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, captioned Shust v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01129 (N.D. Ohio). On May 18, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.). On May 21, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company, members of the Board, Parent, Merger Sub and Stone Point in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Rabinowitz v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04484 (S.D.N.Y.). Similar to the complaints described above, the complaints allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the Definitive Proxy Statement, in the case of the Shust complaint and the Rabinowitz complaint, and the Preliminary Proxy Statement, in the case of the Raul complaint, omitted or misrepresented material information concerning the merger. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger unless additional disclosure is provided and costs of the applicable action, including for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 21, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed a complaint against the Company and certain of its directors in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. Zyskind, et al., Case No. 2018-0358 (Del. Ch.). The complaint alleges that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties to the Company and seeks, among other things, a declaration that the merger was not entirely fair and an order rescinding the merger or granting an award of rescissory damages, interest and expenses, including reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees and costs.

SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES

The Company believes that no further disclosure is required to supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement under applicable laws; however, to avoid the risk that the litigations described above may delay or otherwise adversely affect the consummation of the merger and to minimize the expense of defending such actions, the Company wishes to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger, all of which are set forth below, in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above. Nothing in this Supplement shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the complaints described above that any additional disclosure was or is required. The information contained in this Supplement is incorporated by reference into the Definitive Proxy Statement. To the extent that information in this Supplement differs from or updates information contained in the Definitive Proxy Statement, the information in this Supplement shall supersede or supplement the information in the Definitive Proxy Statement. Capitalized terms used herein, but not otherwise defined, shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Definitive Proxy Statement. Unless stated otherwise, new text is bolded and underlined to highlight the supplemental information being provided to you and deleted text is bolded and denoted by a strike-through.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee; Recommendation of the Board of Directors; Fairness of the Merger"" on page 5 as follows:

Based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, as well as on the basis of the other factors described below (including, among other factors, the financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Special Committee by Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. (""Deutsche Bank"")), which the Board adopted as its own, the Board unanimously resolved on behalf of the Company that the Merger Agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were fair, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and the Unaffiliated Stockholders, approved the Merger Agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby and recommended that the stockholders of the Company vote ""FOR"" the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Background of the Merger"" on page 21 as follows:

From time to time, during the two year period preceding the execution of the Merger Agreement, representatives of the Company have held discussions with representatives of various strategic and financial sponsor parties regarding potential strategic transactions involving the Company, including discussions in November and December 2017 related to a potential going-private transaction with five other parties. None of the discussions with those five other parties in November and December 2017 developed beyond a preliminary nature or resulted in any proposal. Except as discussed below or as previously disclosed in the Company's filings with the SEC, none of those discussions progressed beyond the preliminary phase. In connection with those discussions, the Company has entered into confidentiality and standstill agreements with several parties, including three of the five parties referenced above. As of the date of this proxy statement, pursuant to action taken by the Special Committee under the Merger Agreement, none of the parties with whom the Company has entered into confidentiality and standstill agreements is prohibited by the terms of such agreements from making offers to acquire the Company.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Background of the Merger"" on page 22 as follows:

In the context of Stone Point's due diligence investigation, and inquiries from and preliminary discussions with other financial sponsor parties in November and December 2017 regarding a potential going-private referred to above, on December 7, 2017, the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family amended its Schedule 13D to state that the members of the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family were considering plans and proposals with respect to their investments in the Company that could result in any of the events described in Item 4 of Schedule 13D.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Myhre v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04175 (S.D.N.Y.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the passage.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to look for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company made supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain allegations raised in the complaints described above, including the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since no agreement was found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Company made supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to the lawsuit, but there is no explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

The following information supplements the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Background of the Merger"" beginning on page 21 of the Definitive Proxy Statement.

On April 9, 2018, the Company filed its preliminary proxy statement with the SEC. After receiving comments from the staff of the SEC, the Company amended its proxy statement in response to such comments, and on May 4, 2018, the Company filed the Definitive Proxy Statement.

As previously disclosed in the First Supplement, following the filing of the Definitive Proxy Statement, from May 9, 2018 through May 21, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed putative class action lawsuits against the Company and members of the Board under the following captions, (i) Bartholomew v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04178 (S.D.N.Y.), (ii) Myhre v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04175 (S.D.N.Y.), (iii) Shust v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01129 (N.D. Ohio), (iv) Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.), and (v) Rabinowitz v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04484 (S.D.N.Y.). The complaints generally alleged that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the preliminary proxy statement or Definitive Proxy Statement, as applicable, allegedly omitted material information with respect to the merger, thus rendering the applicable proxy statement false and misleading. The complaints sought, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger and costs of the applicable action, including reasonable allowance for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 17, 2018, Carl Icahn contacted Mr. Zyskind and informed Mr. Zyskind that he and his affiliates (the ""Icahn 13D Parties"") had acquired approximately 9.4% of the outstanding common stock of the Company and intended on soliciting proxies against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Later that day, representatives of Paul, Weiss spoke with Mr. Icahn and one of his associates and discussed Mr. Icahn's opposition to the transaction. The parties subsequently arranged for Mr. Icahn to meet with Mr. Zyskind and Mr. Karfunkel on May 22, 2018.

On May 17, 2018, the Icahn 13D Parties filed a Schedule 13D reflecting their aggregate ownership of approximately 9.4% ownership stake in the Company. The filing disclosed that the Icahn 13D Parties acquired their positions in the belief that the shares were undervalued. In addition, on May 17, 2018, certain affiliates of Mr. Icahn delivered a demand, pursuant to Section 220 of the DGCL, to the Company requesting access to certain stocklist materials of the Company.

Earlier that day, Mr. Icahn delivered an open letter to the Board, which stated that he opposed the merger and intended to solicit proxies against the transaction. The letter also requested that the Company move the record date such that shares held by the Icahn 13D Parties would be able to vote on the merger. In addition, on May 17, 2018, the Icahn 13D Parties filed a preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A, urging the Company's stockholders to vote against the Merger Agreement proposal at the special meeting.

On May 21, 2018, certain affiliates of Mr. Icahn filed a complaint against the Company and certain of its directors in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. Zyskind, et al., Case No. 2018-0358 (Del. Ch.). The complaint alleged that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties to the Company and sought, among other things, a declaration that the merger was not entirely fair and an order rescinding the merger or granting an award of rescissory damages, interest and expenses, including reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees and costs, but did not seek to enjoin the merger.

In the afternoon on May 22, 2018, Mr. Zyskind and Mr. Karfunkel, along with representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch and the Company's proxy solicitor, met with Mr. Icahn and his associates to discuss the transaction. Mr. Zyskind and Mr. Karfunkel informed Mr. Icahn that they believed that $13.50 per share was a fair price, particularly given the current issues faced by the Company and summarized in the section of the Definitive Proxy Statement titled ""Special Factors--Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee; Recommendation of the Board of Directors; Fairness of the Merger,"" and that they were not prepared to increase the merger consideration at such time.

Also on May 22, 2018, the Company delivered an investor presentation to Institutional Shareholder Services (""ISS""), which provided in part that the merger was the result of a robust process and removed significant business risks and uncertainties. The presentation was also filed as an exhibit to Schedule 14A.

On May 23, 2018, the Icahn 13D Parties filed an amendment to their preliminary proxy statement and also delivered an investor presentation to ISS, asking ISS to recommend that stockholders vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. In response, on May 24, 2018, the Company delivered a supplemental presentation to Glass Lewis & Co. (""Glass Lewis"") and ISS disputing some of the Icahn 13D Parties' claims. The next day, the Company issued a press release announcing the recommendation by Glass Lewis that the Company stockholders vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the special meeting of stockholders.

On May 24, 2018, the Company filed the First Supplement to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above. Nothing in the First Supplement should be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality of the disclosures set forth therein. The Company specifically denies all allegations in the complaints described above that any additional disclosure was or is required.

On May 25, 2018, ISS's report was released, which recommended that stockholders vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the special meeting of stockholders, and the Icahn 13D Parties filed a supplemental investor presentation contesting certain of the claims in the Company's supplemental presentation.

Over the course of the next week, members of the Special Committee along with representatives of the Special Committee and the Company met with representatives of the Company's largest stockholders to solicit their support for the merger and also met with representatives of the proxy advisory firms to seek such firms' endorsement of the merger.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Myhre v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04175 (S.D.N.Y.)"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following sentence:

""As previously disclosed in the First Supplement, following the filing of the Definitive Proxy Statement, from May 9, 2018 through May 21, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed putative class action lawsuits against the Company and members of the Board under the following captions, (i) Bartholomew v.

Therefore, the Target Case is mentioned in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following sentence:

""On May 24, 2018, the Company filed the First Supplement to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above.""

This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, which includes the Target Case. Therefore, the answer to the first question is ""Yes"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

LITIGATION RELATED TO THE MERGER

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is Bartholomew v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04178 (S.D.N.Y.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the section ""LITIGATION RELATED TO THE MERGER"". Therefore, I can confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. In the section ""SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES"", I found that the Company ""wishes to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger, all of which are set forth below, in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above."" This indicates that the Company is making supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuit, which includes the Target Case. Therefore, I can confirm that the Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit.

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

Since I did not find any explicit settlement, the next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

Since I did not find any explicit agreement, the next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my analysis, I can summarize the results as follows:

* The Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, which includes the Target Case.
* There is no explicit settlement or agreement related to the Target Case.

On April 9, 2018, the Company filed its preliminary proxy statement with the SEC. After receiving comments from the staff of the SEC, the Company amended its proxy statement in response to such comments, and on May 4, 2018, the Company filed the Definitive Proxy Statement.

As previously disclosed in the First Supplement, following the filing of the Definitive Proxy Statement, from May 9, 2018 through May 21, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed putative class action lawsuits against the Company and members of the Board under the following captions, (i) Bartholomew v.

The complaints sought, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger and costs of the applicable action, including reasonable allowance for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 17, 2018, Carl Icahn contacted Mr. Zyskind and informed Mr. Zyskind that he and his affiliates (the ""Icahn 13D Parties"") had acquired approximately 9.4% of the outstanding common stock of the Company and intended on soliciting proxies against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Later that day, representatives of Paul, Weiss spoke with Mr. Icahn and one of his associates and discussed Mr. Icahn's opposition to the transaction. The parties subsequently arranged for Mr. Icahn to meet with Mr. Zyskind and Mr. Karfunkel on May 22, 2018.

On May 17, 2018, the Icahn 13D Parties filed a Schedule 13D reflecting their aggregate ownership of approximately 9.4% ownership stake in the Company. The filing disclosed that the Icahn 13D Parties acquired their positions in the belief that the shares were undervalued. In addition, on May 17, 2018, certain affiliates of Mr. Icahn delivered a demand, pursuant to Section 220 of the DGCL, to the Company requesting access to certain stocklist materials of the Company.

Earlier that day, Mr. Icahn delivered an open letter to the Board, which stated that he opposed the merger and intended to solicit proxies against the transaction. The letter also requested that the Company move the record date such that shares held by the Icahn 13D Parties would be able to vote on the merger. In addition, on May 17, 2018, the Icahn 13D Parties filed a preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A, urging the Company's stockholders to vote against the Merger Agreement proposal at the special meeting.

On May 21, 2018, certain affiliates of Mr. Icahn filed a complaint against the Company and certain of its directors in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. Zyskind, et al., Case No. 2018-0358 (Del. Ch.). The complaint alleged that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties to the Company and sought, among other things, a declaration that the merger was not entirely fair and an order rescinding the merger or granting an award of rescissory damages, interest and expenses, including reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees and costs, but did not seek to enjoin the merger.

In the afternoon on May 22, 2018, Mr. Zyskind and Mr. Karfunkel, along with representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch and the Company's proxy solicitor, met with Mr. Icahn and his associates to discuss the transaction. Mr. Zyskind and Mr. Karfunkel informed Mr. Icahn that they believed that $13.50 per share was a fair price, particularly given the current issues faced by the Company and summarized in the section of the Definitive Proxy Statement titled ""Special Factors--Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee; Recommendation of the Board of Directors; Fairness of the Merger,"" and that they were not prepared to increase the merger consideration at such time.

Also on May 22, 2018, the Company delivered an investor presentation to Institutional Shareholder Services (""ISS""), which provided in part that the merger was the result of a robust process and removed significant business risks and uncertainties. The presentation was also filed as an exhibit to Schedule 14A.

On May 23, 2018, the Icahn 13D Parties filed an amendment to their preliminary proxy statement and also delivered an investor presentation to ISS, asking ISS to recommend that stockholders vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. In response, on May 24, 2018, the Company delivered a supplemental presentation to Glass Lewis & Co. (""Glass Lewis"") and ISS disputing some of the Icahn 13D Parties' claims. The next day, the Company issued a press release announcing the recommendation by Glass Lewis that the Company stockholders vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the special meeting of stockholders.

On May 24, 2018, the Company filed the First Supplement to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above. Nothing in the First Supplement should be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality of the disclosures set forth therein. The Company specifically denies all allegations in the complaints described above that any additional disclosure was or is required.

On May 25, 2018, ISS's report was released, which recommended that stockholders vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the special meeting of stockholders, and the Icahn 13D Parties filed a supplemental investor presentation contesting certain of the claims in the Company's supplemental presentation.

Over the course of the next week, members of the Special Committee along with representatives of the Special Committee and the Company met with representatives of the Company's largest stockholders to solicit their support for the merger and also met with representatives of the proxy advisory firms to seek such firms' endorsement of the merger.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is Bartholomew v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04178 (S.D.N.Y.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following sentence:

""As previously disclosed in the First Supplement, following the filing of the Definitive Proxy Statement, from May 9, 2018 through May 21, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed putative class action lawsuits against the Company and members of the Board under the following captions, (i) Bartholomew v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04178 (S.D.N.Y.)...""

This confirms that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following sentence:

""On May 24, 2018, the Company filed the First Supplement to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above.""

This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, which includes the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, which includes the Target Case. However, I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case.

Following the filing of the Definitive Proxy Statement, on May 9, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed putative class action lawsuits against the Company and members of the Board (other than Mr. Serock) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Bartholomew v.

The complaints are substantially identical and allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, the ""Exchange Act"") because the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on April 9, 2018 (the ""Preliminary Proxy Statement"") allegedly omitted material information with respect to the merger, thus rendering the Preliminary Proxy Statement false and misleading. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger and costs of the applicable action, including reasonable allowance for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 18, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Raul v.

Similar to the complaints described above, the complaints allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the Definitive Proxy Statement, in the case of the Shust complaint and the Rabinowitz complaint, and the Preliminary Proxy Statement, in the case of the Raul complaint, omitted or misrepresented material information concerning the merger. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger unless additional disclosure is provided and costs of the applicable action, including for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 21, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed a complaint against the Company and certain of its directors in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Icahn Partners LP, et al. v.

SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES

The Company believes that no further disclosure is required to supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement under applicable laws; however, to avoid the risk that the litigations described above may delay or otherwise adversely affect the consummation of the merger and to minimize the expense of defending such actions, the Company wishes to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger, all of which are set forth below, in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above. Nothing in this Supplement shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the complaints described above that any additional disclosure was or is required. The information contained in this Supplement is incorporated by reference into the Definitive Proxy Statement. To the extent that information in this Supplement differs from or updates information contained in the Definitive Proxy Statement, the information in this Supplement shall supersede or supplement the information in the Definitive Proxy Statement. Capitalized terms used herein, but not otherwise defined, shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Definitive Proxy Statement. Unless stated otherwise, new text is bolded and underlined to highlight the supplemental information being provided to you and deleted text is bolded and denoted by a strike-through.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee; Recommendation of the Board of Directors; Fairness of the Merger"" on page 5 as follows:

Based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, as well as on the basis of the other factors described below (including, among other factors, the financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Special Committee by Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. (""Deutsche Bank"")), which the Board adopted as its own, the Board unanimously resolved on behalf of the Company that the Merger Agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were fair, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and the Unaffiliated Stockholders, approved the Merger Agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby and recommended that the stockholders of the Company vote ""FOR"" the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Background of the Merger"" on page 21 as follows:

From time to time, during the two year period preceding the execution of the Merger Agreement, representatives of the Company have held discussions with representatives of various strategic and financial sponsor parties regarding potential strategic transactions involving the Company, including discussions in November and December 2017 related to a potential going-private transaction with five other parties. None of the discussions with those five other parties in November and December 2017 developed beyond a preliminary nature or resulted in any proposal. Except as discussed below or as previously disclosed in the Company's filings with the SEC, none of those discussions progressed beyond the preliminary phase. In connection with those discussions, the Company has entered into confidentiality and standstill agreements with several parties, including three of the five parties referenced above. As of the date of this proxy statement, pursuant to action taken by the Special Committee under the Merger Agreement, none of the parties with whom the Company has entered into confidentiality and standstill agreements is prohibited by the terms of such agreements from making offers to acquire the Company.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Background of the Merger"" on page 22 as follows:

In the context of Stone Point's due diligence investigation, and inquiries from and preliminary discussions with other financial sponsor parties in November and December 2017 regarding a potential going-private referred to above, on December 7, 2017, the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family amended its Schedule 13D to state that the members of the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family were considering plans and proposals with respect to their investments in the Company that could result in any of the events described in Item 4 of Schedule 13D.

The following information supplements the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Background of the Merger"" beginning on page 21 of the Definitive Proxy Statement.

On April 9, 2018, the Company filed its preliminary proxy statement with the SEC. After receiving comments from the staff of the SEC, the Company amended its proxy statement in response to such comments, and on May 4, 2018, the Company filed the Definitive Proxy Statement.

As previously disclosed in the First Supplement, following the filing of the Definitive Proxy Statement, from May 9, 2018 through May 21, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed putative class action lawsuits against the Company and members of the Board under the following captions, (i) Bartholomew v.

Similar to the complaints described above, the complaints allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the Definitive Proxy Statement, in the case of the Shust complaint and the Rabinowitz complaint, and the Preliminary Proxy Statement, in the case of the Raul complaint, omitted or misrepresented material information concerning the merger. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger unless additional disclosure is provided and costs of the applicable action, including for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 21, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed a complaint against the Company and certain of its directors in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. Zyskind, et al., Case No. 2018-0358 (Del. Ch.). The complaint alleges that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties to the Company and seeks, among other things, a declaration that the merger was not entirely fair and an order rescinding the merger or granting an award of rescissory damages, interest and expenses, including reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees and costs.

SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES

The Company believes that no further disclosure is required to supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement under applicable laws; however, to avoid the risk that the litigations described above may delay or otherwise adversely affect the consummation of the merger and to minimize the expense of defending such actions, the Company wishes to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger, all of which are set forth below, in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above. Nothing in this Supplement shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the complaints described above that any additional disclosure was or is required. The information contained in this Supplement is incorporated by reference into the Definitive Proxy Statement. To the extent that information in this Supplement differs from or updates information contained in the Definitive Proxy Statement, the information in this Supplement shall supersede or supplement the information in the Definitive Proxy Statement. Capitalized terms used herein, but not otherwise defined, shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Definitive Proxy Statement. Unless stated otherwise, new text is bolded and underlined to highlight the supplemental information being provided to you and deleted text is bolded and denoted by a strike-through.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee; Recommendation of the Board of Directors; Fairness of the Merger"" on page 5 as follows:

Based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, as well as on the basis of the other factors described below (including, among other factors, the financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Special Committee by Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. (""Deutsche Bank"")), which the Board adopted as its own, the Board unanimously resolved on behalf of the Company that the Merger Agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were fair, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and the Unaffiliated Stockholders, approved the Merger Agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby and recommended that the stockholders of the Company vote ""FOR"" the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Background of the Merger"" on page 21 as follows:

From time to time, during the two year period preceding the execution of the Merger Agreement, representatives of the Company have held discussions with representatives of various strategic and financial sponsor parties regarding potential strategic transactions involving the Company, including discussions in November and December 2017 related to a potential going-private transaction with five other parties. None of the discussions with those five other parties in November and December 2017 developed beyond a preliminary nature or resulted in any proposal. Except as discussed below or as previously disclosed in the Company's filings with the SEC, none of those discussions progressed beyond the preliminary phase. In connection with those discussions, the Company has entered into confidentiality and standstill agreements with several parties, including three of the five parties referenced above. As of the date of this proxy statement, pursuant to action taken by the Special Committee under the Merger Agreement, none of the parties with whom the Company has entered into confidentiality and standstill agreements is prohibited by the terms of such agreements from making offers to acquire the Company.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Background of the Merger"" on page 22 as follows:

In the context of Stone Point's due diligence investigation, and inquiries from and preliminary discussions with other financial sponsor parties in November and December 2017 regarding a potential going-private referred to above, on December 7, 2017, the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family amended its Schedule 13D to state that the members of the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family were considering plans and proposals with respect to their investments in the Company that could result in any of the events described in Item 4 of Schedule 13D.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Background of the Merger"" on pages 23-24 as follows:

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the passage.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to look for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company made supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain allegations raised in the complaints, including the one filed in the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I found supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

The following information supplements the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Background of the Merger"" beginning on page 21 of the Definitive Proxy Statement.

On April 9, 2018, the Company filed its preliminary proxy statement with the SEC. After receiving comments from the staff of the SEC, the Company amended its proxy statement in response to such comments, and on May 4, 2018, the Company filed the Definitive Proxy Statement.

As previously disclosed in the First Supplement, following the filing of the Definitive Proxy Statement, from May 9, 2018 through May 21, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed putative class action lawsuits against the Company and members of the Board under the following captions, (i) Bartholomew v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04178 (S.D.N.Y.), (ii) Myhre v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04175 (S.D.N.Y.), (iii) Shust v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01129 (N.D. Ohio), (iv) Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.), and (v) Rabinowitz v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04484 (S.D.N.Y.). The complaints generally alleged that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the preliminary proxy statement or Definitive Proxy Statement, as applicable, allegedly omitted material information with respect to the merger, thus rendering the applicable proxy statement false and misleading. The complaints sought, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger and costs of the applicable action, including reasonable allowance for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 17, 2018, Carl Icahn contacted Mr. Zyskind and informed Mr. Zyskind that he and his affiliates (the ""Icahn 13D Parties"") had acquired approximately 9.4% of the outstanding common stock of the Company and intended on soliciting proxies against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Later that day, representatives of Paul, Weiss spoke with Mr. Icahn and one of his associates and discussed Mr. Icahn's opposition to the transaction. The parties subsequently arranged for Mr. Icahn to meet with Mr. Zyskind and Mr. Karfunkel on May 22, 2018.

On May 17, 2018, the Icahn 13D Parties filed a Schedule 13D reflecting their aggregate ownership of approximately 9.4% ownership stake in the Company. The filing disclosed that the Icahn 13D Parties acquired their positions in the belief that the shares were undervalued. In addition, on May 17, 2018, certain affiliates of Mr. Icahn delivered a demand, pursuant to Section 220 of the DGCL, to the Company requesting access to certain stocklist materials of the Company.

Earlier that day, Mr. Icahn delivered an open letter to the Board, which stated that he opposed the merger and intended to solicit proxies against the transaction. The letter also requested that the Company move the record date such that shares held by the Icahn 13D Parties would be able to vote on the merger. In addition, on May 17, 2018, the Icahn 13D Parties filed a preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A, urging the Company's stockholders to vote against the Merger Agreement proposal at the special meeting.

On May 21, 2018, certain affiliates of Mr. Icahn filed a complaint against the Company and certain of its directors in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. Zyskind, et al., Case No. 2018-0358 (Del. Ch.). The complaint alleged that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties to the Company and sought, among other things, a declaration that the merger was not entirely fair and an order rescinding the merger or granting an award of rescissory damages, interest and expenses, including reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees and costs, but did not seek to enjoin the merger.

In the afternoon on May 22, 2018, Mr. Zyskind and Mr. Karfunkel, along with representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch and the Company's proxy solicitor, met with Mr. Icahn and his associates to discuss the transaction. Mr. Zyskind and Mr. Karfunkel informed Mr. Icahn that they believed that $13.50 per share was a fair price, particularly given the current issues faced by the Company and summarized in the section of the Definitive Proxy Statement titled ""Special Factors--Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee; Recommendation of the Board of Directors; Fairness of the Merger,"" and that they were not prepared to increase the merger consideration at such time.

Also on May 22, 2018, the Company delivered an investor presentation to Institutional Shareholder Services (""ISS""), which provided in part that the merger was the result of a robust process and removed significant business risks and uncertainties. The presentation was also filed as an exhibit to Schedule 14A.

On May 23, 2018, the Icahn 13D Parties filed an amendment to their preliminary proxy statement and also delivered an investor presentation to ISS, asking ISS to recommend that stockholders vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. In response, on May 24, 2018, the Company delivered a supplemental presentation to Glass Lewis & Co. (""Glass Lewis"") and ISS disputing some of the Icahn 13D Parties' claims. The next day, the Company issued a press release announcing the recommendation by Glass Lewis that the Company stockholders vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the special meeting of stockholders.

On May 24, 2018, the Company filed the First Supplement to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above. Nothing in the First Supplement should be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality of the disclosures set forth therein. The Company specifically denies all allegations in the complaints described above that any additional disclosure was or is required.

On May 25, 2018, ISS's report was released, which recommended that stockholders vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the special meeting of stockholders, and the Icahn 13D Parties filed a supplemental investor presentation contesting certain of the claims in the Company's supplemental presentation.

Over the course of the next week, members of the Special Committee along with representatives of the Special Committee and the Company met with representatives of the Company's largest stockholders to solicit their support for the merger and also met with representatives of the proxy advisory firms to seek such firms' endorsement of the merger.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following sentence:

""As previously disclosed in the First Supplement, following the filing of the Definitive Proxy Statement, from May 9, 2018 through May 21, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed putative class action lawsuits against the Company and members of the Board under the following captions, (i) Bartholomew v.

AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04484 (S.D.N.Y.).""

The Target Case is indeed mentioned, so I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following sentence:

""On May 24, 2018, the Company filed the First Supplement to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above.""

This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, which includes the Target Case. Therefore, I will answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I will answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

Litigation Related to the Merger

Following the filing by the Company of its definitive proxy statement with the SEC on May 4, 2018, in connection with the special meeting of the stockholders of the Company to consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt the Amended Merger Agreement by and among Evergreen Parent, Evergreen Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Evergreen Parent (""Merger Sub""), and the Company, on May 9, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed putative class action lawsuits against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Bartholomew v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04178 (S.D.N.Y.) and Myhre v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04175 (S.D.N.Y.), respectively. The complaints were substantially identical and alleged that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on April 9, 2018 allegedly omitted material information with respect to the merger, thus rendering the preliminary proxy statement false and misleading. The complaints sought, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger and costs of the applicable action, including reasonable allowance for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees. On July 6, 2018, the Bartholomew and Myhre actions were voluntarily dismissed.

On May 15, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, captioned Shust v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01129 (N.D. Ohio). On May 18, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.). On May 21, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company, members of the Board (other than Mr. Serock), Evergreen Parent, Merger Sub and Stone Point in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Rabinowitz v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04484 (S.D.N.Y.). Similar to the complaints described above, the complaints alleged that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the definitive proxy statement, in the case of the Shust complaint and the Rabinowitz complaint, and the preliminary proxy statement, in the case of the Raul complaint, omitted or misrepresented material information concerning the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger unless additional disclosure was provided and costs of the applicable action, including for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees. The Shust, Raul and Rabinowitz actions were voluntarily dismissed on August 29, 2018, September 7, 2018 and July 23, 2018, respectively.

On May 31, 2018, Pompano Beach Police & Firefighters' Retirement System, City of Lauderhill Police Officers' Retirement System and West Palm Beach Police Pension Fund filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company's board of directors, Stone Point, Trident Pine Acquisition LP (""Trident Pine""), Trident VII Professionals Fund, Trident VII, Trident VII DE Parallel Fund, and Trident VII Parallel Fund (collectively, the ""Trident Funds"") in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, Case No. 2018-0396-AGB (the ""2018 Pompano Action""). The complaint in the 2018 Pompano Action alleges that defendants Zyskind, G. Karfunkel, L. Karfunkel, Gulkowitz, Fisch, DeCarlo, and Rivera breached their fiduciary duties, which resulted in an unfair merger stock price through an unfair process. The complaint alleges additional claims for breaches of fiduciary duty against Zyskind, G. Karfunkel and L. Karfunkel in their capacity as officers and directors of the Company and as controlling stockholders of the Company. The complaint alleges that Stone Point, Trident Pine and the Trident Funds aided and abetted the breaches of fiduciary duties.

On June 4, 2018, Cambridge filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company's board of directors, the Estate of Michael Karfunkel, Evergreen Parent, K-Z Evergreen, LLC, Merger Sub, Trident Pine and Stone Point in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, Case No. 2018-0402-AGB (the ""2018 Cambridge Action""). On September 24, 2018, Plaintiff in the 2018 Cambridge Action filed a Verified Supplemental and Amended Stockholder class action complaint (the ""Amended Complaint""). Similar to the 2018 Pompano Action, the Amended Complaint alleges that the director defendants breached their fiduciary duties, which resulted in an unfair merger stock price through an unfair process. The Estate of Michael Karfunkel is not named as a Defendant in the Amended Complaint. The complaint alleges an additional claim for breach of fiduciary duty against Zyskind, G. Karfunkel, and L. Karfunkel in their capacity as controlling shareholders of the Company and alleges that Evergreen Parent, K-Z Evergreen, Merger Sub, Stone Point, and Trident Pine aided and abetted the foregoing breaches of fiduciary duties.

On October 10, 2018, the court directed counsel in the 2018 Pompano Action and the 2018 Cambridge Action to file a proposed order to formally consolidate the 2018 Pompano Action and the 2018 Cambridge Action, designate the lead plaintiffs, and provide for the designation or filing of an operative consolidated complaint.

The Company believes the allegations in the merger litigation described above are without merit.

Other than as discussed above, the Company is not involved presently in any material litigation nor, to the Company's knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against the Company or its properties.

12. Segments

The Company operates three business segments: Small Commercial Business; Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty; and Specialty Program. The Corporate and Other segment represents the activities of the holding company as well as a portion of service and fee income. Investment income and realized gains (losses) on investments are determined by calculating an overall annual return on cash and invested assets and applying that overall return to the cash and invested assets by segment. Ceding commission is allocated to each segment based on that segment's proportionate share of the Company's overall acquisition costs. Interest expense is allocated based on gross written premiums by segment. Income taxes are allocated on a pro-rata basis based on the Company's effective tax rate. Additionally, management reviews the performance of underwriting results in assessing the performance of and making decisions regarding the allocation of resources to the segments. Underwriting results excludes, primarily, service and fee income, investment income and other revenues, other expenses, interest expense and income taxes. Management believes that providing information in this manner is essential to providing the Company's stockholders with an understanding of the Company's business and operating performance.

The Company allocates certain underwriting, general and administrative (""U, G & A"") expenses to its operating segments, and regularly assesses the allocation assumptions and methodologies. In the current period, the Company changed how it allocates U, G & A expenses to the respective operating segments. Beginning on July 1, 2018, the Company began allocating all U, G & A expenses based on net earned premiums to better align its shared expenses with premiums earned, which provides the chief operating decision maker with information to properly assess segment performance based on the current circumstances of the underlying business mix within segments. In prior periods, portions of U, G & A expenses were allocated based on various metrics. Prior period amounts have been revised using the new allocation methodology for comparability.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, neither Small Commercial Business nor Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty derived over ten percent of its total revenue from one customer. During the three months ended September 30, 2018, Specialty Program did not derive over ten percent of its total revenue from one customer. Specialty Program derived over ten percent of its total revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 from a customer that was formerly a consolidated entity and was included in the transfer of the U.S.-based fee businesses completed on February 28, 2018. See Note 13. ""Divestiture"" for additional information on the transfer.

The following tables summarize the results of operations of the business segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017:

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the section ""Litigation Related to the Merger"". Therefore, I can confirm that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that there is no explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. However, I found that the complaint in the 2018 Cambridge Action was amended, but this is not directly related to the Target Case. I also found that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to lawsuits, but it is not clear if this is related to the Target Case. However, I found that the Raul action was voluntarily dismissed on September 7, 2018, which suggests that the dismissal might be related to supplemental disclosure. 

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that there is no explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that there is no explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the voluntary dismissal of the Raul action on September 7, 2018, might imply an agreement, but it is not strongly implied.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to lawsuits, but it is not clear if this is related to the Target Case. However, the Raul action was voluntarily dismissed on September 7, 2018, which suggests that the dismissal might be related to supplemental disclosure. I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

On May 18, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.). On May 21, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company, members of the Board, Parent, Merger Sub and Stone Point in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Rabinowitz v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04484 (S.D.N.Y.). Similar to the complaints described above, the complaints allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the Definitive Proxy Statement, in the case of the Shust complaint and the Rabinowitz complaint, and the Preliminary Proxy Statement, in the case of the Raul complaint, omitted or misrepresented material information concerning the merger. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger unless additional disclosure is provided and costs of the applicable action, including for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 21, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed a complaint against the Company and certain of its directors in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. Zyskind, et al., Case No. 2018-0358 (Del. Ch.). The complaint alleges that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties to the Company and seeks, among other things, a declaration that the merger was not entirely fair and an order rescinding the merger or granting an award of rescissory damages, interest and expenses, including reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees and costs.

SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES

The Company believes that no further disclosure is required to supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement under applicable laws; however, to avoid the risk that the litigations described above may delay or otherwise adversely affect the consummation of the merger and to minimize the expense of defending such actions, the Company wishes to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger, all of which are set forth below, in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above. Nothing in this Supplement shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the complaints described above that any additional disclosure was or is required. The information contained in this Supplement is incorporated by reference into the Definitive Proxy Statement. To the extent that information in this Supplement differs from or updates information contained in the Definitive Proxy Statement, the information in this Supplement shall supersede or supplement the information in the Definitive Proxy Statement. Capitalized terms used herein, but not otherwise defined, shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Definitive Proxy Statement. Unless stated otherwise, new text is bolded and underlined to highlight the supplemental information being provided to you and deleted text is bolded and denoted by a strike-through.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee; Recommendation of the Board of Directors; Fairness of the Merger"" on page 5 as follows:

Based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, as well as on the basis of the other factors described below (including, among other factors, the financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Special Committee by Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. (""Deutsche Bank"")), which the Board adopted as its own, the Board unanimously resolved on behalf of the Company that the Merger Agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were fair, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and the Unaffiliated Stockholders, approved the Merger Agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby and recommended that the stockholders of the Company vote ""FOR"" the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Background of the Merger"" on page 21 as follows:

From time to time, during the two year period preceding the execution of the Merger Agreement, representatives of the Company have held discussions with representatives of various strategic and financial sponsor parties regarding potential strategic transactions involving the Company, including discussions in November and December 2017 related to a potential going-private transaction with five other parties. None of the discussions with those five other parties in November and December 2017 developed beyond a preliminary nature or resulted in any proposal. Except as discussed below or as previously disclosed in the Company's filings with the SEC, none of those discussions progressed beyond the preliminary phase. In connection with those discussions, the Company has entered into confidentiality and standstill agreements with several parties, including three of the five parties referenced above. As of the date of this proxy statement, pursuant to action taken by the Special Committee under the Merger Agreement, none of the parties with whom the Company has entered into confidentiality and standstill agreements is prohibited by the terms of such agreements from making offers to acquire the Company.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Background of the Merger"" on page 22 as follows:

In the context of Stone Point's due diligence investigation, and inquiries from and preliminary discussions with other financial sponsor parties in November and December 2017 regarding a potential going-private referred to above, on December 7, 2017, the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family amended its Schedule 13D to state that the members of the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family were considering plans and proposals with respect to their investments in the Company that could result in any of the events described in Item 4 of Schedule 13D.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Background of the Merger"" on pages 23-24 as follows:

Also in early January, counsel to the Trident Funds, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (""Skadden""), and counsel to the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (""Paul, Weiss""), negotiated joint bidding arrangements related to a potential proposal to acquire the outstanding shares of common stock not held or controlled by the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family and its affiliates and certain related parties, including (1) that the new cash investment by Stone Point and the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family, together with the rollover of shares of common stock of the Company acquired in the May 2017 private placement, would be in the form of preferred equity; and (2) that there would be an adjustment in the ownership interests between holders of preferred equity and common equity at the time of a future IPO or other exit event if at such time there was a reserve deficiency or reserve excess with respect to premiums earned on or prior to March 31, 2018, subject to a cap and cut-back depending on the internal rate of return achieved by Trident on its investment (the ""reserve adjustment""); and (3) that Mr. Zyskind would serve as the Company's Chief Executive Officer after completion of a transaction.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm whether the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. Zyskind, et al., Case No. 2018-0358 (Del. Ch.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following paragraph:

""On May 21, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed a complaint against the Company and certain of its directors in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. Zyskind, et al., Case No. 2018-0358 (Del. Ch.).""

This confirms that the Target Case is indeed discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found the following paragraph:

""The Company believes that no further disclosure is required to supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement under applicable laws; however, to avoid the risk that the litigations described above may delay or otherwise adversely affect the consummation of the merger and to minimize the expense of defending such actions, the Company wishes to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger, all of which are set forth below, in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above.""

This indicates that the Company is making supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuits, including the Target Case. Therefore, the answer to the first question is ""Yes"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement or MOU related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine whether an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any indication of an implied agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since no agreement was found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, the final answers are:

On May 17, 2018, the Icahn 13D Parties filed a Schedule 13D reflecting their aggregate ownership of approximately 9.4% ownership stake in the Company. The filing disclosed that the Icahn 13D Parties acquired their positions in the belief that the shares were undervalued. In addition, on May 17, 2018, certain affiliates of Mr. Icahn delivered a demand, pursuant to Section 220 of the DGCL, to the Company requesting access to certain stocklist materials of the Company.

Earlier that day, Mr. Icahn delivered an open letter to the Board, which stated that he opposed the merger and intended to solicit proxies against the transaction. The letter also requested that the Company move the record date such that shares held by the Icahn 13D Parties would be able to vote on the merger. In addition, on May 17, 2018, the Icahn 13D Parties filed a preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A, urging the Company's stockholders to vote against the Merger Agreement proposal at the special meeting.

On May 21, 2018, certain affiliates of Mr. Icahn filed a complaint against the Company and certain of its directors in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. Zyskind, et al., Case No. 2018-0358 (Del. Ch.). The complaint alleged that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties to the Company and sought, among other things, a declaration that the merger was not entirely fair and an order rescinding the merger or granting an award of rescissory damages, interest and expenses, including reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees and costs, but did not seek to enjoin the merger.

In the afternoon on May 22, 2018, Mr. Zyskind and Mr. Karfunkel, along with representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch and the Company's proxy solicitor, met with Mr. Icahn and his associates to discuss the transaction. Mr. Zyskind and Mr. Karfunkel informed Mr. Icahn that they believed that $13.50 per share was a fair price, particularly given the current issues faced by the Company and summarized in the section of the Definitive Proxy Statement titled ""Special Factors--Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee; Recommendation of the Board of Directors; Fairness of the Merger,"" and that they were not prepared to increase the merger consideration at such time.

Also on May 22, 2018, the Company delivered an investor presentation to Institutional Shareholder Services (""ISS""), which provided in part that the merger was the result of a robust process and removed significant business risks and uncertainties. The presentation was also filed as an exhibit to Schedule 14A.

On May 23, 2018, the Icahn 13D Parties filed an amendment to their preliminary proxy statement and also delivered an investor presentation to ISS, asking ISS to recommend that stockholders vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. In response, on May 24, 2018, the Company delivered a supplemental presentation to Glass Lewis & Co. (""Glass Lewis"") and ISS disputing some of the Icahn 13D Parties' claims. The next day, the Company issued a press release announcing the recommendation by Glass Lewis that the Company stockholders vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the special meeting of stockholders.

On May 24, 2018, the Company filed the First Supplement to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above. Nothing in the First Supplement should be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality of the disclosures set forth therein. The Company specifically denies all allegations in the complaints described above that any additional disclosure was or is required.

On May 25, 2018, ISS's report was released, which recommended that stockholders vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the special meeting of stockholders, and the Icahn 13D Parties filed a supplemental investor presentation contesting certain of the claims in the Company's supplemental presentation.

Over the course of the next week, members of the Special Committee along with representatives of the Special Committee and the Company met with representatives of the Company's largest stockholders to solicit their support for the merger and also met with representatives of the proxy advisory firms to seek such firms' endorsement of the merger.

On May 29, 2018, the Company issued a press release announcing that proxy advisory firm Egan-Jones joined Glass Lewis in recommending that the Company stockholders vote in favor of the transaction.

On June 1, 2018, certain affiliates of Mr. Icahn informed the Company that they would assert appraisal rights with respect to their shares, pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.

Based on a preliminary assessment of proxies received by the Company's proxy solicitor as of June 3, 2018, it appeared that sufficient proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement under Section 251 of the DGCL had been obtained, but that sufficient proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement from a majority of Public Stockholders would not be obtained. Accordingly, Parent determined to request that the Company adjourn the special meeting in order to allow the Company additional time to solicit further support for the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

On June 3, 2018, Mr. Zyskind contacted Mr. Icahn and informed him that Parent would be requesting that the Company adjourn the special meeting and requested a meeting with Mr. Icahn to discuss the transaction. Paul, Weiss and an associate of Mr. Icahn also had discussions regarding the request to adjourn the special meeting. In addition, on June 3, 2018, the Special Committee met with its legal advisors to discuss the current status of the transaction, which included a discussion of Mr. Icahn's previous statements.

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the provided filing excerpts. The Target Case is ""Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. Barry D. Zyskind, et al., C.A.

Upon reviewing the filing excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the passage.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that on May 24, 2018, the Company filed the First Supplement to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above. This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

Since there is no explicit ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"", the next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

Since there is no explicit agreement, the next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since there is no agreement found, this step is not applicable.

The complaints are substantially identical and allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, the ""Exchange Act"") because the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on April 9, 2018 (the ""Preliminary Proxy Statement"") allegedly omitted material information with respect to the merger, thus rendering the Preliminary Proxy Statement false and misleading. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger and costs of the applicable action, including reasonable allowance for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

As previously disclosed in the First Supplement, following the filing of the Definitive Proxy Statement, from May 9, 2018 through May 21, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed putative class action lawsuits against the Company and members of the Board under the following captions, (i) Bartholomew v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04178 (S.D.N.Y.), (ii) Myhre v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04175 (S.D.N.Y.), (iii) Shust v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01129 (N.D. Ohio), (iv) Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.), and (v) Rabinowitz v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04484 (S.D.N.Y.). The complaints generally alleged that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the preliminary proxy statement or Definitive Proxy Statement, as applicable, allegedly omitted material information with respect to the merger, thus rendering the applicable proxy statement false and misleading. The complaints sought, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger and costs of the applicable action, including reasonable allowance for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 17, 2018, Carl Icahn contacted Mr. Zyskind and informed Mr. Zyskind that he and his affiliates (the ""Icahn 13D Parties"") had acquired approximately 9.4% of the outstanding common stock of the Company and intended on soliciting proxies against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Later that day, representatives of Paul, Weiss spoke with Mr. Icahn and one of his associates and discussed Mr. Icahn's opposition to the transaction. The parties subsequently arranged for Mr. Icahn to meet with Mr. Zyskind and Mr. Karfunkel on May 22, 2018.

On May 17, 2018, the Icahn 13D Parties filed a Schedule 13D reflecting their aggregate ownership of approximately 9.4% ownership stake in the Company. The filing disclosed that the Icahn 13D Parties acquired their positions in the belief that the shares were undervalued. In addition, on May 17, 2018, certain affiliates of Mr. Icahn delivered a demand, pursuant to Section 220 of the DGCL, to the Company requesting access to certain stocklist materials of the Company.

Earlier that day, Mr. Icahn delivered an open letter to the Board, which stated that he opposed the merger and intended to solicit proxies against the transaction. The letter also requested that the Company move the record date such that shares held by the Icahn 13D Parties would be able to vote on the merger. In addition, on May 17, 2018, the Icahn 13D Parties filed a preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A, urging the Company's stockholders to vote against the Merger Agreement proposal at the special meeting.

On May 21, 2018, certain affiliates of Mr. Icahn filed a complaint against the Company and certain of its directors in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. Zyskind, et al., Case No. 2018-0358 (Del. Ch.). The complaint alleged that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties to the Company and sought, among other things, a declaration that the merger was not entirely fair and an order rescinding the merger or granting an award of rescissory damages, interest and expenses, including reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees and costs, but did not seek to enjoin the merger.

In the afternoon on May 22, 2018, Mr. Zyskind and Mr. Karfunkel, along with representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch and the Company's proxy solicitor, met with Mr. Icahn and his associates to discuss the transaction. Mr. Zyskind and Mr. Karfunkel informed Mr. Icahn that they believed that $13.50 per share was a fair price, particularly given the current issues faced by the Company and summarized in the section of the Definitive Proxy Statement titled ""Special Factors--Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee; Recommendation of the Board of Directors; Fairness of the Merger,"" and that they were not prepared to increase the merger consideration at such time.

Also on May 22, 2018, the Company delivered an investor presentation to Institutional Shareholder Services (""ISS""), which provided in part that the merger was the result of a robust process and removed significant business risks and uncertainties. The presentation was also filed as an exhibit to Schedule 14A.

On May 23, 2018, the Icahn 13D Parties filed an amendment to their preliminary proxy statement and also delivered an investor presentation to ISS, asking ISS to recommend that stockholders vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. In response, on May 24, 2018, the Company delivered a supplemental presentation to Glass Lewis & Co. (""Glass Lewis"") and ISS disputing some of the Icahn 13D Parties' claims. The next day, the Company issued a press release announcing the recommendation by Glass Lewis that the Company stockholders vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the special meeting of stockholders.

On May 24, 2018, the Company filed the First Supplement to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above. Nothing in the First Supplement should be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality of the disclosures set forth therein. The Company specifically denies all allegations in the complaints described above that any additional disclosure was or is required.

On May 25, 2018, ISS's report was released, which recommended that stockholders vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the special meeting of stockholders, and the Icahn 13D Parties filed a supplemental investor presentation contesting certain of the claims in the Company's supplemental presentation.

Over the course of the next week, members of the Special Committee along with representatives of the Special Committee and the Company met with representatives of the Company's largest stockholders to solicit their support for the merger and also met with representatives of the proxy advisory firms to seek such firms' endorsement of the merger.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Rabinowitz v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04484 (S.D.N.Y.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following sentence:

""...from May 9, 2018 through May 21, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed putative class action lawsuits against the Company and members of the Board under the following captions,... (v) Rabinowitz v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04484 (S.D.N.Y.).""

This confirms that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following sentence:

""On May 24, 2018, the Company filed the First Supplement to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above.""

This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit. However, I need to confirm that the lawsuit is the Target Case. The sentence mentions ""the complaints described above"", which includes the Target Case. Therefore, I conclude that the supplemental disclosure is associated with the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, I do not need to confirm whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I conclude that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, which is the Target Case. However, I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case.

Zyskind, et al., Case No. 2018-0396 (Del. Ch.). The complaint alleges that the officer and director defendants violated their fiduciary duties to the Company and that Stone Point and certain affiliates aided and abetted in the breaches of the directors' fiduciary duties. The complaint seeks an award of damages, including interest, and fees for attorneys, accountants and experts.

On June 4, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed a putative class action against certain members of the Board, Stone Point and certain funds affiliated with Stone Point in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Cambridge Retirement Sys. v. DeCarlo, Case No. 2018-0402 (Del. Ch.). The complaint alleges that the defendants breached fiduciary duties owed to the Company as directors and controlling shareholders, and that certain funds affiliated with Stone Point aided and abetted in the alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. The complaint also alleges that members of the Board breached their fiduciary duties by failing to ascribe a reasonable value to the still pending derivative lawsuit filed by Cambridge Retirement System in 2014. Plaintiffs are seeking damages, including interest and expenses for attorneys' fees, accountants' fees, and experts' fees.

On May 30, 2018 and June 1, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed two actions in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the Company, captioned Arca Investments, a.s., et al. v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., Case No. 2018-0381 (Del. Ch.) and McLure v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., Case No. 2018-0400 (Del. Ch.), respectively. The complaints are substantially identical and seek to compel the inspection of the Company's books and records pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง 220, as well as an award of plaintiffs' attorneys' fees and expenses.

PARTICIPANTS IN THE SOLICITATION

The Company and its directors and executive officers may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies in connection with the merger.

The Company and certain of its officers and directors are also defendants in three putative securities class action lawsuits filed in March and April of 2017 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Another putative class action, filed in February 2017 in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, was voluntarily dismissed (Miller v. AmTrust, Zyskind, and Pipoly). The three cases in the Southern District of New York have been consolidated under the case name In re AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. Securities Litigation. Plaintiffs in this proceeding filed a consolidated, amended complaint on August 21, 2017. Plaintiffs assert in the consolidated, amended complaint claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

In May and June 2018, Arca and McLure, respectively, commenced legal proceedings against the Company in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware over the scope of the Company's proposed production of documents in response to the Section 220 demands of Arca and McLure. The lawsuits are entitled Arca Investments, A.S., Arca Capital Bohemia, S.A., and Arca Venture Capital A.S. v AmTrust Financial Services, Inc.

SEC Investigation

Since June 2013, the Company has been responding to an investigation by the SEC, which in its course has included a review of the Company's investment in life settlement contracts, acquisition of Luxembourg captives, certain accounting practices, including accounting for loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates for the Company's major business lines and segments, internal controls and other related matters. The Company cannot predict the eventual scope, duration or outcome of such inquiry or whether it could have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. The Company has been responsive to this ongoing inquiry and will continue to be cooperative with regards to any governmental or regulatory inquiries or investigations.

Litigation Related to the Merger

Following the filing by the Company of its definitive proxy statement with the SEC on May 4, 2018 in connection with the special meeting of the stockholders of the Company to consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt the Amended Merger Agreement by and among Evergreen Parent, Evergreen Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Evergreen Parent (""Merger Sub""), and the Company, on May 9, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed putative class action lawsuits against the Company and members of the Board (other than Mr. Serock) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Bartholomew v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04178 (S.D.N.Y.) and Myhre v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04175 (S.D.N.Y.), respectively. The complaints are substantially identical and allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on April 9, 2018 allegedly omitted material information with respect to the merger, thus rendering the preliminary proxy statement false and misleading. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger and costs of the applicable action, including reasonable allowance for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 15, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, captioned Shust v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01129 (N.D. Ohio). On May 18, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.). On May 21, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company, members of the Board, Evergreen Parent, Merger Sub and Stone Point in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Rabinowitz v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04484 (S.D.N.Y.). Similar to the complaints described above, the complaints allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the definitive proxy statement, in the case of the Shust complaint and the Rabinowitz complaint, and the preliminary proxy statement, in the case of the Raul complaint, omitted or misrepresented material information concerning the merger. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger unless additional disclosure is provided and costs of the applicable action, including for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 31, 2018, Pompano Beach Police & Firefighters' Retirement System, City of Lauderhill Police Officers' Retirement System and West Palm Beach Police Pension Fund filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company's board of directors, Stone Point, Trident Pine Acquisition (""Trident Pine""), Trident VII Professionals Fund, Trident VII, Trident VII DE Parallel Fund, and Trident VII Parallel Fund (collectively, the ""Trident Funds"") in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, Case No. 2018-0396-AGB. The complaint alleges that defendants Zyskind, G. Karfunkel. L. Karfunkel, Gulkowitz, Fisch, DeCarlo, and Rivera breached their fiduciary duties, which resulted in an unfair merger stock price through an unfair process. The complaint alleges additional claims for breaches of fiduciary duty against Zyskind, G. Karfunkel and L. Karfunkel in their capacity as officers and directors of the Company and as controlling stockholders of the Company. The complaint alleges that Stone Point, Trident Pine and the Trident Funds aided and abetted the breaches of fiduciary duties.

On June 4, 2018, Cambridge filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company's board of directors, the Estate of Michael Karfunkel, Evergreen Parent, K-Z Evergreen, LLC, Merger Sub, Trident Pine Acquisition LP and Stone Point in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, Case No. 2018-0402-AGB. Similar to the 2018 Pompano Beach action, the complaint alleges that the director defendants breached their fiduciary duties, which resulted in an unfair merger stock price through an unfair process. The complaint alleges an additional claim for breach of fiduciary duty against Zyskind, G. Karfunkel, L. Karfunkel, and M. Karfunkel in their capacity as controlling shareholders of the Company and alleges that Evergreen Parent, Stone Point, and Trident Pine aided and abetted the foregoing breaches of fiduciary duties.

The Company believes the allegations in the merger litigation described above are without merit and is vigorously pursuing its defenses.

Other than as discussed above, the Company is not involved presently in any material litigation nor, to the Company's knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against the Company or its properties.

The complaints sought, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger and costs of the applicable action, including reasonable allowance for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees. On July 6, 2018, the Bartholomew and Myhre actions were voluntarily dismissed.

On May 15, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, captioned Shust v.

On May 18, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.). On May 21, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company, members of the Board (other than Mr. Serock), Evergreen Parent, Merger Sub and Stone Point in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Rabinowitz v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04484 (S.D.N.Y.). Similar to the complaints described above, the complaints alleged that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the definitive proxy statement, in the case of the Shust complaint and the Rabinowitz complaint, and the preliminary proxy statement, in the case of the Raul complaint, omitted or misrepresented material information concerning the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger unless additional disclosure was provided and costs of the applicable action, including for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees. The Shust, Raul and Rabinowitz actions were voluntarily dismissed on August 29, 2018, September 7, 2018 and July 23, 2018, respectively.

On May 31, 2018, Pompano Beach Police & Firefighters' Retirement System, City of Lauderhill Police Officers' Retirement System and West Palm Beach Police Pension Fund filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company's board of directors, Stone Point, Trident Pine Acquisition LP (""Trident Pine""), Trident VII Professionals Fund, Trident VII, Trident VII DE Parallel Fund, and Trident VII Parallel Fund (collectively, the ""Trident Funds"") in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, Case No. 2018-0396-AGB (the ""2018 Pompano Action""). The complaint in the 2018 Pompano Action alleges that defendants Zyskind, G. Karfunkel, L. Karfunkel, Gulkowitz, Fisch, DeCarlo, and Rivera breached their fiduciary duties, which resulted in an unfair merger stock price through an unfair process. The complaint alleges additional claims for breaches of fiduciary duty against Zyskind, G. Karfunkel and L. Karfunkel in their capacity as officers and directors of the Company and as controlling stockholders of the Company. The complaint alleges that Stone Point, Trident Pine and the Trident Funds aided and abetted the breaches of fiduciary duties.

On June 4, 2018, Cambridge filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company's board of directors, the Estate of Michael Karfunkel, Evergreen Parent, K-Z Evergreen, LLC, Merger Sub, Trident Pine and Stone Point in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, Case No. 2018-0402-AGB (the ""2018 Cambridge Action""). On September 24, 2018, Plaintiff in the 2018 Cambridge Action filed a Verified Supplemental and Amended Stockholder class action complaint (the ""Amended Complaint""). Similar to the 2018 Pompano Action, the Amended Complaint alleges that the director defendants breached their fiduciary duties, which resulted in an unfair merger stock price through an unfair process. The Estate of Michael Karfunkel is not named as a Defendant in the Amended Complaint. The complaint alleges an additional claim for breach of fiduciary duty against Zyskind, G. Karfunkel, and L. Karfunkel in their capacity as controlling shareholders of the Company and alleges that Evergreen Parent, K-Z Evergreen, Merger Sub, Stone Point, and Trident Pine aided and abetted the foregoing breaches of fiduciary duties.

On October 10, 2018, the court directed counsel in the 2018 Pompano Action and the 2018 Cambridge Action to file a proposed order to formally consolidate the 2018 Pompano Action and the 2018 Cambridge Action, designate the lead plaintiffs, and provide for the designation or filing of an operative consolidated complaint.

The Company believes the allegations in the merger litigation described above are without merit.

Other than as discussed above, the Company is not involved presently in any material litigation nor, to the Company's knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against the Company or its properties.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm whether the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Arca Investments, a.s., et al. v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc."" with case number 2018-0381. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the section ""Section 220 Demands and Related Legal Proceedings"". The case is referred to as ""Arca Investments, A.S., Arca Capital Bohemia, S.A., and Arca Venture Capital A.S. v AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (Case No. 2018-0381)"".

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the lawsuit was voluntarily dismissed on August 6, 2018. However, there is no explicit mention of a settlement agreement.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

Since there is no explicit settlement agreement, I will search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

Since there is no explicit agreement, I will check if an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since there is no agreement mentioned, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I conclude that the Company did not make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the Target Case. Additionally, there is no explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

The complaint also alleges that members of the Board breached their fiduciary duties by failing to ascribe a reasonable value to the still pending derivative lawsuit filed by Cambridge Retirement System in 2014. Plaintiffs are seeking damages, including interest and expenses for attorneys' fees, accountants' fees, and experts' fees.

On May 30, 2018 and June 1, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed two actions in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the Company, captioned Arca Investments, a.s., et al. v.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Pompano Beach Police & Firefighters' Retirement System, City of Lauderhill Police Officers' Retirement System and West Palm Beach Police Pension Fund v. Zyskind, et al.; Pompano Beach Police & Firefighters' Retirement System, et al. v. Zyskind, et al."" with case number 2018-0396. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following paragraph:

Zyskind, et al., Case No. 2018-0396 (Del. Ch.).""

Therefore, the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement or MOU related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. However, I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will check if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. However, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

The complaints are substantially identical and allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on April 9, 2018 allegedly omitted material information with respect to the merger, thus rendering the preliminary proxy statement false and misleading. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger and costs of the applicable action, including reasonable allowance for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 15, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, captioned Shust v.

Similar to the complaints described above, the complaints allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the definitive proxy statement, in the case of the Shust complaint and the Rabinowitz complaint, and the preliminary proxy statement, in the case of the Raul complaint, omitted or misrepresented material information concerning the merger. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger unless additional disclosure is provided and costs of the applicable action, including for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

The complaint alleges that defendants Zyskind, G. Karfunkel. L. Karfunkel, Gulkowitz, Fisch, DeCarlo, and Rivera breached their fiduciary duties, which resulted in an unfair merger stock price through an unfair process. The complaint alleges additional claims for breaches of fiduciary duty against Zyskind, G. Karfunkel and L.

Similar to the 2018 Pompano Beach action, the complaint alleges that the director defendants breached their fiduciary duties, which resulted in an unfair merger stock price through an unfair process. The complaint alleges an additional claim for breach of fiduciary duty against Zyskind, G. Karfunkel, L. Karfunkel, and M. Karfunkel in their capacity as controlling shareholders of the Company and alleges that Evergreen Parent, Stone Point, and Trident Pine aided and abetted the foregoing breaches of fiduciary duties.

The Company believes the allegations in the merger litigation described above are without merit and is vigorously pursuing its defenses.

Other than as discussed above, the Company is not involved presently in any material litigation nor, to the Company's knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against the Company or its properties.

12. Segments

The Company operates three business segments: Small Commercial Business; Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty; and Specialty Program. The Corporate and Other segment represents the activities of the holding company as well as a portion of service and fee income. Investment income and realized gains (losses) on investments are determined by calculating an overall annual return on cash and invested assets and applying that overall return to the cash and invested assets by segment. Ceding commission is allocated to each segment based on that segment's proportionate share of the Company's overall acquisition costs. Interest expense is allocated based on gross written premiums by segment. Income taxes are allocated on a pro-rata basis based on the Company's effective tax rate. Additionally, management reviews the performance of underwriting results in assessing the performance of and making decisions regarding the allocation of resources to the segments. Underwriting results excludes, primarily, service and fee income, investment income and other revenues, other expenses, interest expense and income taxes. Management believes that providing information in this manner is essential to providing the Company's stockholders with an understanding of the Company's business and operating performance.

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, neither Small Commercial Business nor Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty derived over ten percent of its total revenue from one customer. Specialty Program derived over ten percent of its total revenue during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 from a customer that was formally a consolidated entity and was included in the transfer of the U.S.-based fee businesses completed on February 28, 2018. See Note 13. ""Divestiture"" for additional information on the transfer.

The following tables summarize the results of operations of the business segments for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017:

Following the filing by the Company of its definitive proxy statement with the SEC on May 4, 2018, in connection with the special meeting of the stockholders of the Company to consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt the Amended Merger Agreement by and among Evergreen Parent, Evergreen Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Evergreen Parent (""Merger Sub""), and the Company, on May 9, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed putative class action lawsuits against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Bartholomew v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04178 (S.D.N.Y.) and Myhre v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04175 (S.D.N.Y.), respectively. The complaints were substantially identical and alleged that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on April 9, 2018 allegedly omitted material information with respect to the merger, thus rendering the preliminary proxy statement false and misleading. The complaints sought, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger and costs of the applicable action, including reasonable allowance for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees. On July 6, 2018, the Bartholomew and Myhre actions were voluntarily dismissed.

On May 15, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, captioned Shust v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01129 (N.D. Ohio). On May 18, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.). On May 21, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company, members of the Board (other than Mr. Serock), Evergreen Parent, Merger Sub and Stone Point in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Rabinowitz v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04484 (S.D.N.Y.). Similar to the complaints described above, the complaints alleged that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the definitive proxy statement, in the case of the Shust complaint and the Rabinowitz complaint, and the preliminary proxy statement, in the case of the Raul complaint, omitted or misrepresented material information concerning the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger unless additional disclosure was provided and costs of the applicable action, including for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees. The Shust, Raul and Rabinowitz actions were voluntarily dismissed on August 29, 2018, September 7, 2018 and July 23, 2018, respectively.

On May 31, 2018, Pompano Beach Police & Firefighters' Retirement System, City of Lauderhill Police Officers' Retirement System and West Palm Beach Police Pension Fund filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company's board of directors, Stone Point, Trident Pine Acquisition LP (""Trident Pine""), Trident VII Professionals Fund, Trident VII, Trident VII DE Parallel Fund, and Trident VII Parallel Fund (collectively, the ""Trident Funds"") in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, Case No. 2018-0396-AGB (the ""2018 Pompano Action""). The complaint in the 2018 Pompano Action alleges that defendants Zyskind, G. Karfunkel, L. Karfunkel, Gulkowitz, Fisch, DeCarlo, and Rivera breached their fiduciary duties, which resulted in an unfair merger stock price through an unfair process. The complaint alleges additional claims for breaches of fiduciary duty against Zyskind, G. Karfunkel and L. Karfunkel in their capacity as officers and directors of the Company and as controlling stockholders of the Company. The complaint alleges that Stone Point, Trident Pine and the Trident Funds aided and abetted the breaches of fiduciary duties.

On June 4, 2018, Cambridge filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company's board of directors, the Estate of Michael Karfunkel, Evergreen Parent, K-Z Evergreen, LLC, Merger Sub, Trident Pine and Stone Point in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, Case No. 2018-0402-AGB (the ""2018 Cambridge Action""). On September 24, 2018, Plaintiff in the 2018 Cambridge Action filed a Verified Supplemental and Amended Stockholder class action complaint (the ""Amended Complaint""). Similar to the 2018 Pompano Action, the Amended Complaint alleges that the director defendants breached their fiduciary duties, which resulted in an unfair merger stock price through an unfair process. The Estate of Michael Karfunkel is not named as a Defendant in the Amended Complaint. The complaint alleges an additional claim for breach of fiduciary duty against Zyskind, G. Karfunkel, and L. Karfunkel in their capacity as controlling shareholders of the Company and alleges that Evergreen Parent, K-Z Evergreen, Merger Sub, Stone Point, and Trident Pine aided and abetted the foregoing breaches of fiduciary duties.

On October 10, 2018, the court directed counsel in the 2018 Pompano Action and the 2018 Cambridge Action to file a proposed order to formally consolidate the 2018 Pompano Action and the 2018 Cambridge Action, designate the lead plaintiffs, and provide for the designation or filing of an operative consolidated complaint.

The Company believes the allegations in the merger litigation described above are without merit.

Other than as discussed above, the Company is not involved presently in any material litigation nor, to the Company's knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against the Company or its properties.

12. Segments

The Company operates three business segments: Small Commercial Business; Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty; and Specialty Program. The Corporate and Other segment represents the activities of the holding company as well as a portion of service and fee income. Investment income and realized gains (losses) on investments are determined by calculating an overall annual return on cash and invested assets and applying that overall return to the cash and invested assets by segment. Ceding commission is allocated to each segment based on that segment's proportionate share of the Company's overall acquisition costs. Interest expense is allocated based on gross written premiums by segment. Income taxes are allocated on a pro-rata basis based on the Company's effective tax rate. Additionally, management reviews the performance of underwriting results in assessing the performance of and making decisions regarding the allocation of resources to the segments. Underwriting results excludes, primarily, service and fee income, investment income and other revenues, other expenses, interest expense and income taxes. Management believes that providing information in this manner is essential to providing the Company's stockholders with an understanding of the Company's business and operating performance.

The Company allocates certain underwriting, general and administrative (""U, G & A"") expenses to its operating segments, and regularly assesses the allocation assumptions and methodologies. In the current period, the Company changed how it allocates U, G & A expenses to the respective operating segments. Beginning on July 1, 2018, the Company began allocating all U, G & A expenses based on net earned premiums to better align its shared expenses with premiums earned, which provides the chief operating decision maker with information to properly assess segment performance based on the current circumstances of the underlying business mix within segments. In prior periods, portions of U, G & A expenses were allocated based on various metrics. Prior period amounts have been revised using the new allocation methodology for comparability.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, neither Small Commercial Business nor Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty derived over ten percent of its total revenue from one customer. During the three months ended September 30, 2018, Specialty Program did not derive over ten percent of its total revenue from one customer. Specialty Program derived over ten percent of its total revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 from a customer that was formerly a consolidated entity and was included in the transfer of the U.S.-based fee businesses completed on February 28, 2018. See Note 13. ""Divestiture"" for additional information on the transfer.

The following tables summarize the results of operations of the business segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017:

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Pompano Beach Police & Firefighters' Retirement System, City of Lauderhill Police Officers' Retirement System and West Palm Beach Police Pension Fund v. Zyskind, et al."" with case number ""2018-0396-AGB"" in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the passage.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company making supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will check if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. However, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will summarize the results as follows:

On May 31, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against certain of the Company's directors and officers, Stone Point and certain funds affiliated with Stone Point in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Pompano Beach Police & Firefighters' Retirement System, et al. v. Zyskind, et al., Case No. 2018-0396 (Del. Ch.). The complaint alleges that the officer and director defendants violated their fiduciary duties to the Company and that Stone Point and certain affiliates aided and abetted in the breaches of the directors' fiduciary duties. The complaint seeks an award of damages, including interest, and fees for attorneys, accountants and experts.

On June 4, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed a putative class action against certain members of the Board, Stone Point and certain funds affiliated with Stone Point in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Cambridge Retirement Sys. v. DeCarlo, Case No. 2018-0402 (Del. Ch.). The complaint alleges that the defendants breached fiduciary duties owed to the Company as directors and controlling shareholders, and that certain funds affiliated with Stone Point aided and abetted in the alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. The complaint also alleges that members of the Board breached their fiduciary duties by failing to ascribe a reasonable value to the still pending derivative lawsuit filed by Cambridge Retirement System in 2014. Plaintiffs are seeking damages, including interest and expenses for attorneys' fees, accountants' fees, and experts' fees.

On May 30, 2018 and June 1, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed two actions in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the Company, captioned Arca Investments, a.s., et al. v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., Case No. 2018-0381 (Del. Ch.) and McLure v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., Case No. 2018-0400 (Del. Ch.), respectively.

C. ยง 220, as well as an award of plaintiffs' attorneys' fees and expenses.

PARTICIPANTS IN THE SOLICITATION

The Company and certain of its officers and directors are also defendants in three putative securities class action lawsuits filed in March and April of 2017 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Another putative class action, filed in February 2017 in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, was voluntarily dismissed (Miller v. AmTrust, Zyskind, and Pipoly). The three cases in the Southern District of New York have been consolidated under the case name In re AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. Securities Litigation. Plaintiffs in this proceeding filed a consolidated, amended complaint on August 21, 2017. Plaintiffs assert in the consolidated, amended complaint claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The consolidated, amended complaint adds as defendants BDO USA LLP, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, RBC Capital Markets, LLC, and UBS Securities LLC. Plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount in damages, attorneys' fees, and other relief. The Company believes the allegations are unfounded and is vigorously pursuing its defenses.

Section 220 Demands and Related Legal Proceedings

Additionally, between April 2017 and May 2018, the Company received demands for the inspection of books and records pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, from purported stockholders Rikhard Dauber, Pompano Beach Police & Firefighters Retirement System, Nestor Shust, the City of Lauderhill Police Officers' Retirement Plan, the West Palm Beach Police Pension Fund, Cambridge, the Lislois Family Trust, Arca Capital Group (""Arca"") and Gabriel McLure (""McLure""). In May and June 2018, Arca and McLure, respectively, commenced legal proceedings against the Company in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware over the scope of the Company's proposed production of documents in response to the Section 220 demands of Arca and McLure. The lawsuits are entitled Arca Investments, A.S., Arca Capital Bohemia, S.A., and Arca Venture Capital A.S. v AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (Case No. 2018-0381) and Gabriel McLure v AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (Case No. 2018-0400). The Arca Section 220 demand lawsuit was dismissed voluntarily on August 6, 2018.

SEC Investigation

Since June 2013, the Company has been responding to an investigation by the SEC, which in its course has included a review of the Company's investment in life settlement contracts, acquisition of Luxembourg captives, certain accounting practices, including accounting for loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates for the Company's major business lines and segments, internal controls and other related matters. The Company cannot predict the eventual scope, duration or outcome of such inquiry or whether it could have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. The Company has been responsive to this ongoing inquiry and will continue to be cooperative with regards to any governmental or regulatory inquiries or investigations.

Litigation Related to the Merger

Following the filing by the Company of its definitive proxy statement with the SEC on May 4, 2018 in connection with the special meeting of the stockholders of the Company to consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt the Amended Merger Agreement by and among Evergreen Parent, Evergreen Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Evergreen Parent (""Merger Sub""), and the Company, on May 9, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed putative class action lawsuits against the Company and members of the Board (other than Mr. Serock) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Bartholomew v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04178 (S.D.N.Y.) and Myhre v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04175 (S.D.N.Y.), respectively. The complaints are substantially identical and allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on April 9, 2018 allegedly omitted material information with respect to the merger, thus rendering the preliminary proxy statement false and misleading. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger and costs of the applicable action, including reasonable allowance for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 15, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, captioned Shust v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01129 (N.D. Ohio). On May 18, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.). On May 21, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company, members of the Board, Evergreen Parent, Merger Sub and Stone Point in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Rabinowitz v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04484 (S.D.N.Y.). Similar to the complaints described above, the complaints allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the definitive proxy statement, in the case of the Shust complaint and the Rabinowitz complaint, and the preliminary proxy statement, in the case of the Raul complaint, omitted or misrepresented material information concerning the merger. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger unless additional disclosure is provided and costs of the applicable action, including for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 31, 2018, Pompano Beach Police & Firefighters' Retirement System, City of Lauderhill Police Officers' Retirement System and West Palm Beach Police Pension Fund filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company's board of directors, Stone Point, Trident Pine Acquisition (""Trident Pine""), Trident VII Professionals Fund, Trident VII, Trident VII DE Parallel Fund, and Trident VII Parallel Fund (collectively, the ""Trident Funds"") in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, Case No. 2018-0396-AGB. The complaint alleges that defendants Zyskind, G. Karfunkel. L. Karfunkel, Gulkowitz, Fisch, DeCarlo, and Rivera breached their fiduciary duties, which resulted in an unfair merger stock price through an unfair process. The complaint alleges additional claims for breaches of fiduciary duty against Zyskind, G. Karfunkel and L.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm whether the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is McLure v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., Case No. 2018-0400. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the section ""Section 220 Demands and Related Legal Proceedings"". The case is described as ""Gabriel McLure v AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (Case No. 2018-0400)"".

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement or MOU related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. However, I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will check if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. However, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement or supplemental disclosure related to the Target Case, I will answer ""No"" for both ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""reached_agreement"".

The Company and certain of its officers and directors are also defendants in three putative securities class action lawsuits filed in March and April of 2017 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Another putative class action, filed in February 2017 in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, was voluntarily dismissed (Miller v. AmTrust, Zyskind, and Pipoly). The three cases in the Southern District of New York have been consolidated under the case name In re AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. Securities Litigation. Plaintiffs in this proceeding filed a consolidated, amended complaint on August 21, 2017. Plaintiffs assert in the consolidated, amended complaint claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The consolidated, amended complaint adds as defendants BDO USA LLP, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, RBC Capital Markets, LLC, and UBS Securities LLC. Plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount in damages, attorneys' fees, and other relief.

In May and June 2018, Arca and McLure, respectively, commenced legal proceedings against the Company in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware over the scope of the Company's proposed production of documents in response to the Section 220 demands of Arca and McLure. The lawsuits are entitled Arca Investments, A.S., Arca Capital Bohemia, S.A., and Arca Venture Capital A.S. v AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (Case No. 2018-0381) and Gabriel McLure v AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (Case No. 2018-0400). The Arca Section 220 demand lawsuit was dismissed voluntarily on August 6, 2018. The McLure Section 220 demand lawsuit similarly was dismissed voluntarily on August 22, 2018.

SEC Investigation

Since June 2013, the Company has been responding to an investigation by the SEC, which in its course has included a review of the Company's investment in life settlement contracts, acquisition of Luxembourg captives, certain accounting practices, including accounting for loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates for the Company's major business lines and segments, internal controls and other related matters. The Company cannot predict the eventual scope, duration or outcome of such inquiry or whether it could have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. The Company has been responsive to this ongoing inquiry and will continue to be cooperative with regards to any governmental or regulatory inquiries or investigations.

Litigation Related to the Merger

Following the filing by the Company of its definitive proxy statement with the SEC on May 4, 2018, in connection with the special meeting of the stockholders of the Company to consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt the Amended Merger Agreement by and among Evergreen Parent, Evergreen Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Evergreen Parent (""Merger Sub""), and the Company, on May 9, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed putative class action lawsuits against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Bartholomew v.

The complaints were substantially identical and alleged that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on April 9, 2018 allegedly omitted material information with respect to the merger, thus rendering the preliminary proxy statement false and misleading. The complaints sought, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger and costs of the applicable action, including reasonable allowance for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees. On July 6, 2018, the Bartholomew and Myhre actions were voluntarily dismissed.

On May 15, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, captioned Shust v.

AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04484 (S.D.N.Y.). Similar to the complaints described above, the complaints alleged that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the definitive proxy statement, in the case of the Shust complaint and the Rabinowitz complaint, and the preliminary proxy statement, in the case of the Raul complaint, omitted or misrepresented material information concerning the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger unless additional disclosure was provided and costs of the applicable action, including for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees. The Shust, Raul and Rabinowitz actions were voluntarily dismissed on August 29, 2018, September 7, 2018 and July 23, 2018, respectively.

On May 31, 2018, Pompano Beach Police & Firefighters' Retirement System, City of Lauderhill Police Officers' Retirement System and West Palm Beach Police Pension Fund filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company's board of directors, Stone Point, Trident Pine Acquisition LP (""Trident Pine""), Trident VII Professionals Fund, Trident VII, Trident VII DE Parallel Fund, and Trident VII Parallel Fund (collectively, the ""Trident Funds"") in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, Case No. 2018-0396-AGB (the ""2018 Pompano Action""). The complaint in the 2018 Pompano Action alleges that defendants Zyskind, G. Karfunkel, L. Karfunkel, Gulkowitz, Fisch, DeCarlo, and Rivera breached their fiduciary duties, which resulted in an unfair merger stock price through an unfair process. The complaint alleges additional claims for breaches of fiduciary duty against Zyskind, G. Karfunkel and L. Karfunkel in their capacity as officers and directors of the Company and as controlling stockholders of the Company. The complaint alleges that Stone Point, Trident Pine and the Trident Funds aided and abetted the breaches of fiduciary duties.

On September 24, 2018, Plaintiff in the 2018 Cambridge Action filed a Verified Supplemental and Amended Stockholder class action complaint (the ""Amended Complaint""). Similar to the 2018 Pompano Action, the Amended Complaint alleges that the director defendants breached their fiduciary duties, which resulted in an unfair merger stock price through an unfair process. The Estate of Michael Karfunkel is not named as a Defendant in the Amended Complaint. The complaint alleges an additional claim for breach of fiduciary duty against Zyskind, G. Karfunkel, and L. Karfunkel in their capacity as controlling shareholders of the Company and alleges that Evergreen Parent, K-Z Evergreen, Merger Sub, Stone Point, and Trident Pine aided and abetted the foregoing breaches of fiduciary duties.

On October 10, 2018, the court directed counsel in the 2018 Pompano Action and the 2018 Cambridge Action to file a proposed order to formally consolidate the 2018 Pompano Action and the 2018 Cambridge Action, designate the lead plaintiffs, and provide for the designation or filing of an operative consolidated complaint.

The Company believes the allegations in the merger litigation described above are without merit.

Other than as discussed above, the Company is not involved presently in any material litigation nor, to the Company's knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against the Company or its properties.

12. Segments

The Company operates three business segments: Small Commercial Business; Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty; and Specialty Program. The Corporate and Other segment represents the activities of the holding company as well as a portion of service and fee income. Investment income and realized gains (losses) on investments are determined by calculating an overall annual return on cash and invested assets and applying that overall return to the cash and invested assets by segment. Ceding commission is allocated to each segment based on that segment's proportionate share of the Company's overall acquisition costs. Interest expense is allocated based on gross written premiums by segment. Income taxes are allocated on a pro-rata basis based on the Company's effective tax rate. Additionally, management reviews the performance of underwriting results in assessing the performance of and making decisions regarding the allocation of resources to the segments. Underwriting results excludes, primarily, service and fee income, investment income and other revenues, other expenses, interest expense and income taxes. Management believes that providing information in this manner is essential to providing the Company's stockholders with an understanding of the Company's business and operating performance.

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, neither Small Commercial Business nor Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty derived over ten percent of its total revenue from one customer. Specialty Program derived over ten percent of its total revenue during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 from a customer that was formally a consolidated entity and was included in the transfer of the U.S.-based fee businesses completed on February 28, 2018. See Note 13. ""Divestiture"" for additional information on the transfer.

The following tables summarize the results of operations of the business segments for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017:

</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The Target Case is Cambridge Retirement Sys. v. DeCarlo, Case No. 2018-0402, filed on June 4, 2018, in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found a mention of the case ""Cambridge"" filed on June 4, 2018, in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, which matches the Target Case. Therefore, I can confirm that there is a discussion around the Target Case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger in response to the lawsuit, specifically the Target Case. Although there are mentions of other lawsuits and their allegations, there is no mention of supplemental disclosure related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, I do not need to confirm whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my review, I did not find any evidence of supplemental disclosure or an agreement related to the Target Case.

On May 15, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, captioned Shust v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01129 (N.D. Ohio). On May 18, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.). On May 21, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company, members of the Board (other than Mr. Serock), Evergreen Parent, Merger Sub and Stone Point in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Rabinowitz v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04484 (S.D.N.Y.). Similar to the complaints described above, the complaints alleged that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the definitive proxy statement, in the case of the Shust complaint and the Rabinowitz complaint, and the preliminary proxy statement, in the case of the Raul complaint, omitted or misrepresented material information concerning the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger unless additional disclosure was provided and costs of the applicable action, including for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees. The Shust, Raul and Rabinowitz actions were voluntarily dismissed on August 29, 2018, September 7, 2018 and July 23, 2018, respectively.

On May 31, 2018, Pompano Beach Police & Firefighters' Retirement System, City of Lauderhill Police Officers' Retirement System and West Palm Beach Police Pension Fund filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company's board of directors, Stone Point, Trident Pine Acquisition LP (""Trident Pine""), Trident VII Professionals Fund, Trident VII, Trident VII DE Parallel Fund, and Trident VII Parallel Fund (collectively, the ""Trident Funds"") in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, Case No. 2018-0396-AGB (the ""2018 Pompano Action""). The complaint in the 2018 Pompano Action alleges that defendants Zyskind, G. Karfunkel, L. Karfunkel, Gulkowitz, Fisch, DeCarlo, and Rivera breached their fiduciary duties, which resulted in an unfair merger stock price through an unfair process. The complaint alleges additional claims for breaches of fiduciary duty against Zyskind, G. Karfunkel and L. Karfunkel in their capacity as officers and directors of the Company and as controlling stockholders of the Company. The complaint alleges that Stone Point, Trident Pine and the Trident Funds aided and abetted the breaches of fiduciary duties.

On June 4, 2018, Cambridge filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company's board of directors, the Estate of Michael Karfunkel, Evergreen Parent, K-Z Evergreen, LLC, Merger Sub, Trident Pine and Stone Point in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, Case No. 2018-0402-AGB (the ""2018 Cambridge Action""). On September 24, 2018, Plaintiff in the 2018 Cambridge Action filed a Verified Supplemental and Amended Stockholder class action complaint (the ""Amended Complaint""). Similar to the 2018 Pompano Action, the Amended Complaint alleges that the director defendants breached their fiduciary duties, which resulted in an unfair merger stock price through an unfair process. The Estate of Michael Karfunkel is not named as a Defendant in the Amended Complaint. The complaint alleges an additional claim for breach of fiduciary duty against Zyskind, G. Karfunkel, and L. Karfunkel in their capacity as controlling shareholders of the Company and alleges that Evergreen Parent, K-Z Evergreen, Merger Sub, Stone Point, and Trident Pine aided and abetted the foregoing breaches of fiduciary duties.

On October 10, 2018, the court directed counsel in the 2018 Pompano Action and the 2018 Cambridge Action to file a proposed order to formally consolidate the 2018 Pompano Action and the 2018 Cambridge Action, designate the lead plaintiffs, and provide for the designation or filing of an operative consolidated complaint.

The Company believes the allegations in the merger litigation described above are without merit.

Other than as discussed above, the Company is not involved presently in any material litigation nor, to the Company's knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against the Company or its properties.

12. Segments

The Company operates three business segments: Small Commercial Business; Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty; and Specialty Program. The Corporate and Other segment represents the activities of the holding company as well as a portion of service and fee income. Investment income and realized gains (losses) on investments are determined by calculating an overall annual return on cash and invested assets and applying that overall return to the cash and invested assets by segment. Ceding commission is allocated to each segment based on that segment's proportionate share of the Company's overall acquisition costs. Interest expense is allocated based on gross written premiums by segment. Income taxes are allocated on a pro-rata basis based on the Company's effective tax rate. Additionally, management reviews the performance of underwriting results in assessing the performance of and making decisions regarding the allocation of resources to the segments. Underwriting results excludes, primarily, service and fee income, investment income and other revenues, other expenses, interest expense and income taxes. Management believes that providing information in this manner is essential to providing the Company's stockholders with an understanding of the Company's business and operating performance.

The Company allocates certain underwriting, general and administrative (""U, G & A"") expenses to its operating segments, and regularly assesses the allocation assumptions and methodologies. In the current period, the Company changed how it allocates U, G & A expenses to the respective operating segments. Beginning on July 1, 2018, the Company began allocating all U, G & A expenses based on net earned premiums to better align its shared expenses with premiums earned, which provides the chief operating decision maker with information to properly assess segment performance based on the current circumstances of the underlying business mix within segments. In prior periods, portions of U, G & A expenses were allocated based on various metrics. Prior period amounts have been revised using the new allocation methodology for comparability.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, neither Small Commercial Business nor Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty derived over ten percent of its total revenue from one customer. During the three months ended September 30, 2018, Specialty Program did not derive over ten percent of its total revenue from one customer. Specialty Program derived over ten percent of its total revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 from a customer that was formerly a consolidated entity and was included in the transfer of the U.S.-based fee businesses completed on February 28, 2018. See Note 13. ""Divestiture"" for additional information on the transfer.

The following tables summarize the results of operations of the business segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017:

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2018-0402
- **case name**: Cambridge Retirement Sys. v. DeCarlo
- **case filing date**: 2018-06-04
- **case count**: Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Cambridge Retirement Sys. v. DeCarlo"" with case number 2018-0402. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following paragraph:

""On June 4, 2018, Cambridge filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company's board of directors, the Estate of Michael Karfunkel, Evergreen Parent, K-Z Evergreen, LLC, Merger Sub, Trident Pine and Stone Point in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, Case No. 2018-0402-AGB (the ""2018 Cambridge Action"").""

This confirms that the Target Case is indeed discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found the following paragraph:

""On September 24, 2018, Plaintiff in the 2018 Cambridge Action filed a Verified Supplemental and Amended Stockholder class action complaint (the ""Amended Complaint"").""

However, this paragraph does not explicitly mention that the Company agreed or planned to make supplemental disclosure or amendment. Instead, it mentions that the Plaintiff filed a Verified Supplemental and Amended Stockholder class action complaint.

But then I found another paragraph that mentions:

""On October 10, 2018, the court directed counsel in the 2018 Pompano Action and the 2018 Cambridge Action to file a proposed order to formally consolidate the 2018 Pompano Action and the 2018 Cambridge Action, designate the lead plaintiffs, and provide for the designation or filing of an operative consolidated complaint.""

This paragraph does not mention supplemental disclosure either.

However, I found that the filing does not mention the Company making supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit. Therefore, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I already determined that the answer to ""supplemental_disclosure"" is ""No"", I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my analysis, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```

    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",

In general, the complaints assert claims against the Company and the Company's Board, with Tesla and the Offeror as additional defendants in the Kip Leggett v.

Since the Target Case is mentioned, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to look for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the Company has made supplemental disclosure:

""Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by adding a subsection immediately following the subsection entitled ""Stockholder Approval Not Required,"" which new subsection is entitled ""Legal Proceedings - Stockholder Litigation"" and under such subsection, adding the following paragraphs:""

This indicates that the Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit. However, it is not explicitly stated that the supplemental disclosure is specifically in response to the Target Case. Since the supplemental disclosure is mentioned in the context of the lawsuits, including the Target Case, I will assume that it is associated with the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine whether an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since no agreement was found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, but it is not explicitly stated that the supplemental disclosure is specifically in response to the Target Case. However, since the supplemental disclosure is mentioned in the context of the lawsuits, including the Target Case, I will assume that it is associated with the Target Case. I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since no agreement was found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, but it is not explicitly stated that the supplemental disclosure is specifically in response to the Target Case. I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

Although the Company expects to incur legal fees in connection with the below legal proceedings, the Company is unable to estimate the amount of such legal fees and therefore, such fees will be expensed in the period the legal services are performed.

Stockholder Litigation

In connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, nine purported class action lawsuits have been filed. Five complaints, captioned Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00377 (filed February 26, 2019), Shiva Stein v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00395 (filed February 26, 2019), Joel Rosenfeld IRA v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00413 (filed March 1, 2019), Franck Prissert v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00429 (filed March 4, 2019) and Jonathan Mantak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et. al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00451 (filed March 7, 2019) were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. Two complaints, captioned John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00448 (filed March 4, 2019) and Sabatini v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00443 (filed March 1, 2019), were filed in the United States District Court District of Delaware. One complaint, captioned Davis Rodden v. Steven Bilodeau, et al., Case No. 2019-0176 (filed March 4, 2019), was filed in the Delaware Chancery Court and was voluntarily dismissed on April 3, 2019. One complaint, captioned Jack Phillipps v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01927 (filed February 28, 2019), was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

In general, the complaints assert claims against the Company and the Company's Board, with Tesla and Cambria Acquisition Corp. and as additional defendants in the Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Sabatini v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., and John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al. complaints. The complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants failed to make adequate disclosures in the Schedule 14D-9 filed by Maxwell Technologies on February 20, 2019. The complaints seek, among other things, to enjoin the proposed transaction, rescission of the proposed transaction should it be completed, and other equitable relief. The Company believes the respective allegations against it in these complaints lack merit, and the Company intends to vigorously defend the actions. As such, the Company cannot determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that a loss will be incurred nor can it estimate the range of any such potential loss. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued an amount for any potential loss associated with this action, but an adverse result could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operation.

FCPA Matter

In January 2011, the Company reached settlements with the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ"") with respect to charges asserted by the SEC and DOJ relating to the anti-bribery, books and records, internal controls, and disclosure provisions of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"") and other securities laws violations. The Company paid the monetary penalties under these settlements in installments such that all monetary penalties were paid in full by January 2013. With respect to the DOJ charges, a judgment of dismissal was issued in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California on March 28, 2014.

On October 15, 2013, the Company received an informal notice from the DOJ that an indictment against the former Senior Vice President and General Manager of its Swiss subsidiary had been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. The indictment is against the individual, a former officer, and not against the Company and the Company does not foresee that further penalties or fines could be assessed against it as a corporate entity for this matter. However, the Company may be required throughout the term of the action to advance the legal fees and costs incurred by the individual defendant and to incur other financial obligations. While the Company maintains directors' and officers' insurance policies which are intended to cover legal expenses related to its indemnification obligations in situations such as these, the Company cannot determine if and to what extent the insurance policy will cover the ongoing legal fees for this matter. Accordingly, the legal fees that may be incurred by the Company in defending this former officer could have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operation.

Swiss Bribery Matter

In August 2013, the Company's former Swiss subsidiary was served with a search warrant from the Swiss federal prosecutor's office. At the end of the search, the Swiss federal prosecutor presented the Company with a listing of the materials gathered by the representatives and then removed the materials from its premises for keeping at the prosecutor's office. Based upon the Company's exposure to the case, the Company believes this action to be related to the same or similar facts and circumstances as the FCPA action previously settled with the SEC and the DOJ. During initial discussions, the Swiss prosecutor has acknowledged both the existence of the Company's deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ and its cooperation efforts thereunder, both of which should have a positive impact on discussions going forward. Additionally, other than the activities previously reviewed in conjunction with the SEC and DOJ matters under the FCPA, the Company has no reason to believe that additional facts or circumstances are under review by the Swiss authorities. In December 2018, the Company sold its Swiss subsidiary as part of the sale of its high voltage product line and agreed to indemnify, within certain parameters, the purchaser for damages which may arise from this matter. To date, the Swiss prosecutor has not issued its formal decision as to whether the charges will be brought against individuals or the Company or whether the proceeding will be abandoned. At this stage in the investigation, the Company is currently unable to determine the extent to which it will be subject to fines in accordance with Swiss bribery laws and what additional expenses will be incurred in order to defend this matter. As such, the Company cannot determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that a loss will be incurred nor can it estimate the range of any such potential loss. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued an amount for any potential loss associated with this action, but an adverse result could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operation.

Government Investigations

In early 2013, the Company voluntarily provided information to the SEC and the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California related to its announcement that it intended to file restated financial statements for fiscal years 2011 and 2012. On June 11, 2015 and June 16, 2016, the Company received subpoenas from the SEC requesting certain documents related to, among other things, the facts and circumstances surrounding the restated financial statements. The Company has provided documents and information to the SEC in response to the subpoenas. In March 2018, the Company consented to an order filed by the SEC without admitting or denying the SEC's findings thereby resolving alleged violations of certain anti-fraud and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws and related rules. Under the terms of the order, the Company was required to pay $2.8 million in a civil penalty and agreed not to commit or cause any violations of certain anti-fraud and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws and related rules. The Company had previously accrued this amount owed as an operating expense in its financial statements in the third quarter of 2017 and paid the amount in full in April 2018. Under the terms of the order, the Company also agreed to certain undertakings related to revenue recognition policies and procedures, including two reporting requirements and a certification of compliance with the undertakings. In April 2019, the Company received confirmation from the SEC that the undertakings set forth in the order are deemed satisfied.

Note 15 - Merger Agreement with Tesla

On February 3, 2019, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") with Tesla, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Tesla"") and Cambria Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Tesla (""Merger Sub""), which contemplates the acquisition of the Company by Tesla, through Merger Sub. The Merger Agreement requires that Tesla commence an all stock exchange offer for all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company (the ""Offer""), followed by a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company pursuant to which the Company will survive as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tesla (the ""Merger"").

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Jack Phillipps v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01927 (filed February 28, 2019)"" in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the Target Case is mentioned in the section ""Stockholder Litigation"" as one of the nine purported class action lawsuits filed in connection with the merger agreement.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will check if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. However, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will not proceed with confirming the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

Plaintiff Jack Phillipps (""Plaintiff"") by and through his undersigned attorneys, brings this class action on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, and alleges the following based upon personal knowledge as to those allegations concerning Plaintiff and, as to all other matters, upon the investigation of counsel, which includes, without limitation: (a) review and analysis of public filings made by Maxwell Technologies, Inc., (""Maxwell"" or the ""Company"") and other related parties and non-parties with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""); (b) review and analysis of press releases and other publications disseminated by certain of the Defendants (defined below) and other related non-parties; (c) review of news articles, shareholder communications, and postings on Maxwell's website concerning the Company's public statements; and (d) review of other publicly available information concerning Maxwell and the Defendants.

NATURE OF THE ACTION

1. Plaintiff brings this class action on behalf of the public shareholders of Maxwell against the Company and members of the Company's Board of Directors (the ""Board"" or the ""Individual Defendants"") for violations of Sections 14(d)(4), 14(e) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act""), 15 U.S.C. ยงยง 78n(d)(4), 78n(e), 78t(a), and SEC Rule 14d-9, 17 C.F.R. ยง240.14d-9(d) (""Rule 14d-9""), in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by Tesla, Inc. (""Tesla"") (the ""Proposed Transaction"").

2. On February 4, 2019, Maxwell announced that the Company had entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger with Tesla (the ""Merger Agreement""), pursuant to which Tesla will commence an all stock exchange offer for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Maxwell (the ""Offer""). Participants will receive shares of Tesla Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share (""Tesla Common Stock""), equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $4.75 by the volume weighted average of the daily volume weighted average of the trading price of one (1) share of Tesla common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market for the five (5) consecutive trading days ending on and including the second trading day immediately preceding the expiration of the Offer (the ""Tesla Trading Price""), subject to the minimum, together with cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Tesla Common Stock (the ""Offer Consideration""), without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. In the event that the Tesla Trading Price is equal to or less than $245.90, the minimum will apply and each share of Maxwell Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn will be exchanged for 0.0193 of a share of Tesla Common Stock.

3. On February 20, 2019, the Company filed an incomplete and materially misleading Solicitation Statement with the SEC (the ""Solicitation Statement"") on Form 14D9 in connection with the Proposed Transaction.

4. Also on February 20, 2019, the Company authorized the filing of a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (the ""Registration Statement,"" and together with the Solicitation Statement the ""Tender Materials"") with the SEC in support of the Proposed Transaction. The Tender Materials omit material information regarding the Proposed Transaction.

5. Accordingly, the failure to adequately disclose such material information constitutes a violation of Sections 14(d), 14(e) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act as Maxwell stockholders need such information in order to make a fully informed decision whether to tender their shares in support of the Proposed Transaction or seek appraisal.

6. As set forth more fully herein, Plaintiff seeks to enjoin Defendants from proceeding with the Proposed Transaction.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. ยง 78aa) and 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 as Plaintiff alleges violations of Sections 14(d)(4), 14(e) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act

Plaintiff Jack Phillipps (""Plaintiff"") by and through his undersigned attorneys, brings this class action on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, and alleges the following based upon personal knowledge as to those allegations concerning Plaintiff and, as to all other matters, upon the investigation of counsel, which includes, without limitation: (a) review and analysis of public filings made by Maxwell Technologies, Inc., (""Maxwell"" or the ""Company"") and other related parties and non-parties with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""); (b) review and analysis of press releases and other publications disseminated by certain of the Defendants (defined below) and other related non-parties; (c) review of news articles, shareholder communications, and postings on Maxwell's website concerning the Company's public statements; and (d) review of other publicly available information concerning Maxwell and the Defendants.

NATURE OF THE ACTION

1. Plaintiff brings this class action on behalf of the public shareholders of Maxwell against the Company and members of the Company's Board of Directors (the ""Board"" or the ""Individual Defendants"") for violations of Sections 14(d)(4), 14(e) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act""), 15 U.S.C. ยงยง 78n(d)(4), 78n(e), 78t(a), and SEC Rule 14d-9, 17 C.F.R. ยง240.14d-9(d) (""Rule 14d-9""), in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by Tesla, Inc. (""Tesla"") (the ""Proposed Transaction"").

2. On February 4, 2019, Maxwell announced that the Company had entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger with Tesla (the ""Merger Agreement""), pursuant to which Tesla will commence an all stock exchange offer for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Maxwell (the ""Offer"").

5. Accordingly, the failure to adequately disclose such material information constitutes a violation of Sections 14(d), 14(e) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act as Maxwell stockholders need such information in order to make a fully informed decision whether to tender their shares in support of the Proposed Transaction or seek appraisal.

6. As set forth more fully herein, Plaintiff seeks to enjoin Defendants from proceeding with the Proposed Transaction.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Jack Phillipps v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al."" with case number 1:19-cv-01927. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the table under Item 12, Exhibits, specifically in the section (a)(5)(K)* as ""Class Action Complaint filed on February 28, 2019 (Jack Phillipps v.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any mention of other agreements related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

There is no implied agreement mentioned in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since there is no mention of any agreement, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the review of the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by adding a subsection immediately following the subsection entitled ""Stockholder Approval Not Required,"" which new subsection is entitled ""Legal Proceedings - Stockholder Litigation"" and under such subsection, adding the following paragraphs:

""In connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, eight purported class action lawsuits have been filed. Five complaints, captioned Kip Leggett v.

Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00395 (filed February 26, 2019), Joel Rosenfeld IRA v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al,. Case No. 3:19-cv-00413 (filed March 1, 2019), Franck Prissert v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00429 (filed March 4, 2019) and Jonathan Mantak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et. al, Case No. 3:19-cv-00451 (filed March 7, 2019) were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. One complaint, captioned John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00448 (filed March 4, 2019), was filed in the United States District Court District of Delaware. One complaint, captioned Davis Rodden v. Steven Bilodeau, et al,. Case No. 2019-0176 (filed March 4, 2019), was filed in the Delaware Chancery Court. One complaint, captioned Jack Phillipps v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al,. Case No. 1:19-cv-01927 (filed February 28, 2019), was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

In general, the complaints assert claims against the Company and the Company's Board, with Tesla and the Offeror as additional defendants in the Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al. and John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al. complaints. The complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants failed to make adequate disclosures in the Schedule 14D-9 filed by Maxwell Technologies on February 20, 2019. The complaints seek, among other things, to enjoin the proposed transaction, rescission of the proposed transaction should it be completed, and other equitable relief.

The Company believes the respective allegations against it in these complaints lack merit, and the Company intends to vigorously defend the actions.

The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complaints which are attached to the Schedule TO as Exhibit (a)(5)(D), Exhibit (a)(5)(E), Exhibit (a)(5)(F), Exhibit (a)(5)(G), Exhibit (a)(5)(H), Exhibit (a)(5)(I), Exhibit (a)(5)(J) and Exhibit (a)(5)(K), respectively.""

Since the Target Case is mentioned, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to look for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the Company has made supplemental disclosure:

""Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by adding a subsection immediately following the subsection entitled ""Stockholder Approval Not Required,"" which new subsection is entitled ""Legal Proceedings - Stockholder Litigation"" and under such subsection, adding the following paragraphs:""

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any valid supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any implied agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

I will search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will check if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. However, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, the final answer is:

{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",

Although the Company expects to incur legal fees in connection with the below legal proceedings, the Company is unable to estimate the amount of such legal fees and therefore, such fees will be expensed in the period the legal services are performed.

Stockholder Litigation

In connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, nine purported class action lawsuits have been filed. Five complaints, captioned Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00377 (filed February 26, 2019), Shiva Stein v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00395 (filed February 26, 2019), Joel Rosenfeld IRA v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00413 (filed March 1, 2019), Franck Prissert v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00429 (filed March 4, 2019) and Jonathan Mantak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et. al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00451 (filed March 7, 2019) were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. Two complaints, captioned John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00448 (filed March 4, 2019) and Sabatini v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00443 (filed March 1, 2019), were filed in the United States District Court District of Delaware. One complaint, captioned Davis Rodden v. Steven Bilodeau, et al., Case No. 2019-0176 (filed March 4, 2019), was filed in the Delaware Chancery Court and was voluntarily dismissed on April 3, 2019. One complaint, captioned Jack Phillipps v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01927 (filed February 28, 2019), was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

In general, the complaints assert claims against the Company and the Company's Board, with Tesla and Cambria Acquisition Corp. and as additional defendants in the Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Sabatini v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., and John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al. complaints. The complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants failed to make adequate disclosures in the Schedule 14D-9 filed by Maxwell Technologies on February 20, 2019. The complaints seek, among other things, to enjoin the proposed transaction, rescission of the proposed transaction should it be completed, and other equitable relief. The Company believes the respective allegations against it in these complaints lack merit, and the Company intends to vigorously defend the actions. As such, the Company cannot determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that a loss will be incurred nor can it estimate the range of any such potential loss. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued an amount for any potential loss associated with this action, but an adverse result could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operation.

FCPA Matter

In January 2011, the Company reached settlements with the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ"") with respect to charges asserted by the SEC and DOJ relating to the anti-bribery, books and records, internal controls, and disclosure provisions of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"") and other securities laws violations. The Company paid the monetary penalties under these settlements in installments such that all monetary penalties were paid in full by January 2013. With respect to the DOJ charges, a judgment of dismissal was issued in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California on March 28, 2014.

On October 15, 2013, the Company received an informal notice from the DOJ that an indictment against the former Senior Vice President and General Manager of its Swiss subsidiary had been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. The indictment is against the individual, a former officer, and not against the Company and the Company does not foresee that further penalties or fines could be assessed against it as a corporate entity for this matter. However, the Company may be required throughout the term of the action to advance the legal fees and costs incurred by the individual defendant and to incur other financial obligations. While the Company maintains directors' and officers' insurance policies which are intended to cover legal expenses related to its indemnification obligations in situations such as these, the Company cannot determine if and to what extent the insurance policy will cover the ongoing legal fees for this matter. Accordingly, the legal fees that may be incurred by the Company in defending this former officer could have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operation.

Swiss Bribery Matter

In August 2013, the Company's former Swiss subsidiary was served with a search warrant from the Swiss federal prosecutor's office. At the end of the search, the Swiss federal prosecutor presented the Company with a listing of the materials gathered by the representatives and then removed the materials from its premises for keeping at the prosecutor's office. Based upon the Company's exposure to the case, the Company believes this action to be related to the same or similar facts and circumstances as the FCPA action previously settled with the SEC and the DOJ. During initial discussions, the Swiss prosecutor has acknowledged both the existence of the Company's deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ and its cooperation efforts thereunder, both of which should have a positive impact on discussions going forward. Additionally, other than the activities previously reviewed in conjunction with the SEC and DOJ matters under the FCPA, the Company has no reason to believe that additional facts or circumstances are under review by the Swiss authorities. In December 2018, the Company sold its Swiss subsidiary as part of the sale of its high voltage product line and agreed to indemnify, within certain parameters, the purchaser for damages which may arise from this matter. To date, the Swiss prosecutor has not issued its formal decision as to whether the charges will be brought against individuals or the Company or whether the proceeding will be abandoned. At this stage in the investigation, the Company is currently unable to determine the extent to which it will be subject to fines in accordance with Swiss bribery laws and what additional expenses will be incurred in order to defend this matter. As such, the Company cannot determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that a loss will be incurred nor can it estimate the range of any such potential loss. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued an amount for any potential loss associated with this action, but an adverse result could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operation.

Government Investigations

In early 2013, the Company voluntarily provided information to the SEC and the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California related to its announcement that it intended to file restated financial statements for fiscal years 2011 and 2012. On June 11, 2015 and June 16, 2016, the Company received subpoenas from the SEC requesting certain documents related to, among other things, the facts and circumstances surrounding the restated financial statements. The Company has provided documents and information to the SEC in response to the subpoenas. In March 2018, the Company consented to an order filed by the SEC without admitting or denying the SEC's findings thereby resolving alleged violations of certain anti-fraud and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws and related rules. Under the terms of the order, the Company was required to pay $2.8 million in a civil penalty and agreed not to commit or cause any violations of certain anti-fraud and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws and related rules. The Company had previously accrued this amount owed as an operating expense in its financial statements in the third quarter of 2017 and paid the amount in full in April 2018. Under the terms of the order, the Company also agreed to certain undertakings related to revenue recognition policies and procedures, including two reporting requirements and a certification of compliance with the undertakings. In April 2019, the Company received confirmation from the SEC that the undertakings set forth in the order are deemed satisfied.

Note 15 - Merger Agreement with Tesla

On February 3, 2019, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") with Tesla, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Tesla"") and Cambria Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Tesla (""Merger Sub""), which contemplates the acquisition of the Company by Tesla, through Merger Sub. The Merger Agreement requires that Tesla commence an all stock exchange offer for all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company (the ""Offer""), followed by a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company pursuant to which the Company will survive as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tesla (the ""Merger"").

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm whether the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Joel Rosenfeld IRA v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00413"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the section ""Stockholder Litigation"". Therefore, the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit. Therefore, the answer to the first question is ""No"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since the answer to the first question is ""No"", I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement or MOU related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, this step is not applicable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Plaintiff Joel Rosenfeld IRA (""Plaintiff""), by and through its undersigned counsel, for its complaint against defendants, alleges upon personal knowledge with respect to itself, and upon information and belief based upon, inter alia, the investigation of counsel as to all other allegations herein, as follows:

NATURE OF THE ACTION

1. This action is brought by Plaintiff against Maxwell Technologies, Inc. (""Maxwell"" or the ""Company"") and the members of its Board of Directors (the ""Board"" or the ""Individual Defendants"") for their violations of Sections 14(e) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act""), 15 U.S.C. ยงยง 78n(e) and 78t(a) and to enjoin the expiration of a tender offer (the ""Tender Offer"") on a proposed transaction, pursuant to which Maxwell will be acquired by Tesla, Inc. (""Tesla"") through its wholly owned subsidiary Cambria Acquisition Corp. (""Offeror"") (the ""Proposed Transaction"").

2. On February 4, 2019, Maxwell issued a press release announcing that it had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") to sell Maxwell to Tesla. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, on February 20, 2019, Offeror commenced the Tender Offer to purchase all outstanding shares of Maxwell for $4.75 per share of Maxwell common stock (the ""Offer Price""). Pursuant to the Tender Offer, each share of Maxwell common stock will be exchanged for a fraction of a share of Tesla's common stock, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $4.75 by a volume weighted average price of one share of Tesla's common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market for the five consecutive trading days preceding the expiration of the Tender Offer, and which is subject to a floor that has been set at 80% of a volume weighted average price of Tesla common stock calculated prior to signing. The Tender Offer is scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on March 19, 2019.

3. On February 20, 2019, defendants filed a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (the ""Recommendation Statement"") with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""). The Recommendation Statement, which recommends that Maxwell stockholders tender their shares in favor of the Proposed Transaction, omits or misrepresents material information concerning, among other things: (i) Maxwell management's financial projections; (ii) potential conflicts of interest faced by the Company's financial advisor, Barclays Capital Inc. (""Barclays""), and Company insiders; and (iii) the data and inputs underlying the financial valuation analyses that support the fairness opinion provided by Barclays. The failure to adequately disclose such material information constitutes a violation of Sections 14(e) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act as Maxwell stockholders need such information in order to make a fully informed decision whether to tender their shares in support of the Proposed Transaction.

4. In short, the Proposed Transaction will unlawfully divest Maxwell's public stockholders of the Company's valuable assets without fully disclosing all material information concerning the Proposed Transaction to Company stockholders. To remedy defendants' Exchange Act violations, Plaintiff seeks to enjoin the expiration of the Tender Offer unless and until such problems are remedied.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. This Court has jurisdiction over the claims asserted herein for violations of Sections 14(e) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act promulgated thereunder pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 78aa, and 28 U.S.C. ยง1331 (federal question jurisdiction).

6. This Court has jurisdiction over defendants because each defendant is either a corporation that conducts business in and maintains operations in this District, or is an individual who has sufficient minimum contacts with this District so as to render the exercise of jurisdiction by this Court permissible under traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.

7. Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391 because Plaintiff's claims arose in this District, where a substantial portion of the actionable conduct took place, where most of the documents are electronically stored, and where the evidence exists. Maxwell is incorporated in Delaware and is headquartered in this District. Moreover, each of the Individual Defendants, as Company officers or directors, either resides in this District or has extensive contacts within this District.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The provided Filing Excerpts contain a complaint filed by Joel Rosenfeld IRA against Maxwell Technologies, Inc. and its Board of Directors. The complaint mentions the case number '19CV0413 LAB AGS, which matches the case number 3:19-cv-00413 in the Target Case. Therefore, the Filing Excerpts do discuss the Target Case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

There is no explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger in response to the lawsuit. The complaint does mention that the defendants filed a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, but it does not indicate that this was a supplemental disclosure made in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

There is no explicit mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement that would indicate a resolution to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

There is no explicit mention of any other type of formal agreement that would indicate a resolution to the case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

There is no strong implication of an agreement between the parties.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Not applicable, as no agreement was found.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, the Company did not make any supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, and there is no indication of an agreement between the parties.

Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al,. Case No. 1:19-cv-01927 (filed February 28, 2019), was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

In general, the complaints assert claims against the Company and the Company's Board, with Tesla and the Offeror as additional defendants in the Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Sabatini v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., and John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al. complaints. The complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants failed to make adequate disclosures in the Schedule 14D-9 filed by Maxwell Technologies on February 20, 2019. The complaints seek, among other things, to enjoin the proposed transaction, rescission of the proposed transaction should it be completed, and other equitable relief.

The Company believes the respective allegations against it in these complaints lack merit, and the Company intends to vigorously defend the actions.

The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complaints which are attached to the Schedule TO as Exhibit (a)(5)(D), Exhibit (a)(5)(E), Exhibit (a)(5)(F), Exhibit (a)(5)(G), Exhibit (a)(5)(H), Exhibit (a)(5)(I), Exhibit (a)(5)(J), and Exhibit (a)(5)(K) and Exhibit (a)(5)(O), respectively.""

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Sabatini v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al."" with case number 1:19-cv-00443. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the passage: ""Two complaints, captioned John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00448 (filed March 4, 2019) and Sabatini v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00443 (filed March 1, 2019), were was filed in the United States District Court District of Delaware."" Therefore, the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. Therefore, the answer to ""supplemental_disclosure"" is ""No"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since the answer to ""supplemental_disclosure"" is ""No"", I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will proceed to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will proceed to check if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement or implication of an agreement, I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I will summarize the results as follows:

{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",

Although the Company expects to incur legal fees in connection with the below legal proceedings, the Company is unable to estimate the amount of such legal fees and therefore, such fees will be expensed in the period the legal services are performed.

Stockholder Litigation

In connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, nine purported class action lawsuits have been filed. Five complaints, captioned Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00377 (filed February 26, 2019), Shiva Stein v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00395 (filed February 26, 2019), Joel Rosenfeld IRA v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00413 (filed March 1, 2019), Franck Prissert v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00429 (filed March 4, 2019) and Jonathan Mantak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et. al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00451 (filed March 7, 2019) were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. Two complaints, captioned John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00448 (filed March 4, 2019) and Sabatini v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00443 (filed March 1, 2019), were filed in the United States District Court District of Delaware. One complaint, captioned Davis Rodden v. Steven Bilodeau, et al., Case No. 2019-0176 (filed March 4, 2019), was filed in the Delaware Chancery Court and was voluntarily dismissed on April 3, 2019. One complaint, captioned Jack Phillipps v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01927 (filed February 28, 2019), was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

In general, the complaints assert claims against the Company and the Company's Board, with Tesla and Cambria Acquisition Corp. and as additional defendants in the Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Sabatini v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., and John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al. complaints. The complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants failed to make adequate disclosures in the Schedule 14D-9 filed by Maxwell Technologies on February 20, 2019. The complaints seek, among other things, to enjoin the proposed transaction, rescission of the proposed transaction should it be completed, and other equitable relief. The Company believes the respective allegations against it in these complaints lack merit, and the Company intends to vigorously defend the actions. As such, the Company cannot determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that a loss will be incurred nor can it estimate the range of any such potential loss. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued an amount for any potential loss associated with this action, but an adverse result could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operation.

FCPA Matter

In January 2011, the Company reached settlements with the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ"") with respect to charges asserted by the SEC and DOJ relating to the anti-bribery, books and records, internal controls, and disclosure provisions of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"") and other securities laws violations. The Company paid the monetary penalties under these settlements in installments such that all monetary penalties were paid in full by January 2013. With respect to the DOJ charges, a judgment of dismissal was issued in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California on March 28, 2014.

On October 15, 2013, the Company received an informal notice from the DOJ that an indictment against the former Senior Vice President and General Manager of its Swiss subsidiary had been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. The indictment is against the individual, a former officer, and not against the Company and the Company does not foresee that further penalties or fines could be assessed against it as a corporate entity for this matter. However, the Company may be required throughout the term of the action to advance the legal fees and costs incurred by the individual defendant and to incur other financial obligations. While the Company maintains directors' and officers' insurance policies which are intended to cover legal expenses related to its indemnification obligations in situations such as these, the Company cannot determine if and to what extent the insurance policy will cover the ongoing legal fees for this matter. Accordingly, the legal fees that may be incurred by the Company in defending this former officer could have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operation.

Swiss Bribery Matter

In August 2013, the Company's former Swiss subsidiary was served with a search warrant from the Swiss federal prosecutor's office. At the end of the search, the Swiss federal prosecutor presented the Company with a listing of the materials gathered by the representatives and then removed the materials from its premises for keeping at the prosecutor's office. Based upon the Company's exposure to the case, the Company believes this action to be related to the same or similar facts and circumstances as the FCPA action previously settled with the SEC and the DOJ. During initial discussions, the Swiss prosecutor has acknowledged both the existence of the Company's deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ and its cooperation efforts thereunder, both of which should have a positive impact on discussions going forward. Additionally, other than the activities previously reviewed in conjunction with the SEC and DOJ matters under the FCPA, the Company has no reason to believe that additional facts or circumstances are under review by the Swiss authorities. In December 2018, the Company sold its Swiss subsidiary as part of the sale of its high voltage product line and agreed to indemnify, within certain parameters, the purchaser for damages which may arise from this matter. To date, the Swiss prosecutor has not issued its formal decision as to whether the charges will be brought against individuals or the Company or whether the proceeding will be abandoned. At this stage in the investigation, the Company is currently unable to determine the extent to which it will be subject to fines in accordance with Swiss bribery laws and what additional expenses will be incurred in order to defend this matter. As such, the Company cannot determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that a loss will be incurred nor can it estimate the range of any such potential loss. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued an amount for any potential loss associated with this action, but an adverse result could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operation.

Government Investigations

In early 2013, the Company voluntarily provided information to the SEC and the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California related to its announcement that it intended to file restated financial statements for fiscal years 2011 and 2012. On June 11, 2015 and June 16, 2016, the Company received subpoenas from the SEC requesting certain documents related to, among other things, the facts and circumstances surrounding the restated financial statements. The Company has provided documents and information to the SEC in response to the subpoenas. In March 2018, the Company consented to an order filed by the SEC without admitting or denying the SEC's findings thereby resolving alleged violations of certain anti-fraud and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws and related rules. Under the terms of the order, the Company was required to pay $2.8 million in a civil penalty and agreed not to commit or cause any violations of certain anti-fraud and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws and related rules. The Company had previously accrued this amount owed as an operating expense in its financial statements in the third quarter of 2017 and paid the amount in full in April 2018. Under the terms of the order, the Company also agreed to certain undertakings related to revenue recognition policies and procedures, including two reporting requirements and a certification of compliance with the undertakings. In April 2019, the Company received confirmation from the SEC that the undertakings set forth in the order are deemed satisfied.

Note 15 - Merger Agreement with Tesla

On February 3, 2019, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") with Tesla, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Tesla"") and Cambria Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Tesla (""Merger Sub""), which contemplates the acquisition of the Company by Tesla, through Merger Sub. The Merger Agreement requires that Tesla commence an all stock exchange offer for all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company (the ""Offer""), followed by a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company pursuant to which the Company will survive as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tesla (the ""Merger"").

I will check if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. However, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will not proceed with confirming whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" since I did not find any explicit mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit. I will also answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"" since I did not find any explicit mention of a settlement, MOU, or other formal agreement related to the Target Case.

Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than four (4) business days following the date on which Tesla files its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018), Tesla will commence the Offer to purchase each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock for a fraction of a share of Tesla Common Stock, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $4.75 by the volume weighted average closing sale price of one (1) share of Tesla Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (""NASDAQ"") for the five (5) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the second trading day prior to the date of the expiration of the Offer (the ""Tesla Trading Price""). However, in the event that the Tesla Trading Price is equal to or less than $245.90, then each share of Company Common Stock shall be exchanged for 0.0193 of a share of Tesla Common Stock. Such shares of Tesla Common Stock, plus any cash paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Tesla Common Stock, is referred to as the ""Offer Consideration"".

COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

Plaintiff, by his undersigned attorneys, for this complaint against defendants, alleges upon personal knowledge with respect to himself, and upon information and belief based upon, inter alia, the investigation of counsel as to all other allegations herein, as follows:

NATURE OF THE ACTION

1. This action stems from a proposed transaction announced on February 4, 2019 (the ""Proposed Transaction""), pursuant to which Maxwell Technologies, Inc. (""Maxwell"" or the ""Company"") will be acquired by Tesla, Inc. (""Parent"") and Cambria Acquisition Corporation (""Merger Sub,"" and together with Parent, ""Tesla"").

2. On February 3, 2019, Maxwell's Board of Directors (the ""Board"" or ""Individual Defendants"") caused the Company to enter into an agreement and plan of merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") with Tesla. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub commenced a tender offer (the ""Tender Offer"") to acquire each issued and outstanding share of Maxwell common stock. Specifically, each share of Maxwell common stock will be exchanged for a fraction of a share of Tesla's common stock, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $4.75 by a volume weighted average price of one share of Tesla's common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the five consecutive trading days preceding the expiration of the Tender Offer. The Tender Offer is set to expire on March 19, 2019.

3. On February 20, 2019, defendants filed a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement (the ""Solicitation Statement"") with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") in connection with the Proposed Transaction.

4. The Solicitation Statement omits material information with respect to the Proposed Transaction, which renders the Solicitation Statement false and misleading. Accordingly, plaintiff alleges herein that defendants violated Sections 14(e), 14(d), and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""1934 Act"") in connection with the Solicitation Statement.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. This Court has jurisdiction over all claims asserted herein pursuant to Section 27 of the 1934 Act because the claims asserted herein arise under Sections 14(e), 14(d), and 20(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 14a-9.

6. This Court has jurisdiction over defendants because each defendant is either a corporation that conducts business in and maintains operations within this District, or is an individual with sufficient minimum contacts with this District so as to make the exercise of jurisdiction by this Court permissible under traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Sabatini v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al."" with case number ""1:19-cv-00443"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the provided excerpts. The caption of the complaint matches the Target Case, and the filing date is also consistent.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Not applicable since I did not find any agreement.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I conclude that the Company did not make or plan to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit. Additionally, I did not find any evidence of a settlement or agreement related to the Target Case.

Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by adding a subsection immediately following the subsection entitled ""Stockholder Approval Not Required,"" which new subsection is entitled ""Legal Proceedings - Stockholder Litigation"" and under such subsection, adding the following paragraphs:

Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al,. Case No. 1:19-cv-01927 (filed February 28, 2019), was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

In general, the complaints assert claims against the Company and the Company's Board, with Tesla and the Offeror as additional defendants in the Kip Leggett v.

The complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants failed to make adequate disclosures in the Schedule 14D-9 filed by Maxwell Technologies on February 20, 2019. The complaints seek, among other things, to enjoin the proposed transaction, rescission of the proposed transaction should it be completed, and other equitable relief.

The Company believes the respective allegations against it in these complaints lack merit, and the Company intends to vigorously defend the actions.

The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complaints which are attached to the Schedule TO as Exhibit (a)(5)(D), Exhibit (a)(5)(E), Exhibit (a)(5)(F), Exhibit (a)(5)(G), Exhibit (a)(5)(H), Exhibit (a)(5)(I), Exhibit (a)(5)(J) and Exhibit (a)(5)(K), respectively.""

This confirms that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**
The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the Company has made amendments to the Schedule 14D-9, but it is not explicitly stated that the amendments were made in response to the lawsuit. However, the amendments do address the allegations made in the complaints, including the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**
The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Davis Rodden v. Steven Bilodeau, et al., Case No. 2019-0176. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the subsection ""Legal Proceedings - Stockholder Litigation"". Therefore, I can confirm that the Target Case is discussed in the filing.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. However, I found that the Company amended and restated Item 8 of Schedule 14D-9 and the disclosure in the subsection ""Legal Proceedings - Stockholder Litigation"". But this is not explicitly stated as a response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement. However, I will first check if the case was dismissed. According to the Filing Excerpts, the complaint Davis Rodden v. Steven Bilodeau, et al., Case No. 2019-0176, was voluntarily dismissed on April 3, 2019. There is no explicit mention of a settlement agreement or MOU.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

Since I did not find any explicit settlement, I will search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

Since I did not find any explicit agreement, I will check if an agreement is strongly implied. However, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will not proceed with this step.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I can summarize the results as follows:

- The Company did not make any supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit.
- There is no explicit agreement or implied agreement.

Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01927 (filed February 28, 2019), was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

In general, the complaints assert claims against the Company and the Company's Board, with Tesla and Cambria Acquisition Corp. and as additional defendants in the Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Sabatini v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., and John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al. complaints. The complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants failed to make adequate disclosures in the Schedule 14D-9 filed by Maxwell Technologies on February 20, 2019. The complaints seek, among other things, to enjoin the proposed transaction, rescission of the proposed transaction should it be completed, and other equitable relief. The Company believes the respective allegations against it in these complaints lack merit, and the Company intends to vigorously defend the actions. As such, the Company cannot determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that a loss will be incurred nor can it estimate the range of any such potential loss. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued an amount for any potential loss associated with this action, but an adverse result could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operation.

FCPA Matter

In January 2011, the Company reached settlements with the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ"") with respect to charges asserted by the SEC and DOJ relating to the anti-bribery, books and records, internal controls, and disclosure provisions of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"") and other securities laws violations. The Company paid the monetary penalties under these settlements in installments such that all monetary penalties were paid in full by January 2013. With respect to the DOJ charges, a judgment of dismissal was issued in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California on March 28, 2014.

On October 15, 2013, the Company received an informal notice from the DOJ that an indictment against the former Senior Vice President and General Manager of its Swiss subsidiary had been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. The indictment is against the individual, a former officer, and not against the Company and the Company does not foresee that further penalties or fines could be assessed against it as a corporate entity for this matter. However, the Company may be required throughout the term of the action to advance the legal fees and costs incurred by the individual defendant and to incur other financial obligations. While the Company maintains directors' and officers' insurance policies which are intended to cover legal expenses related to its indemnification obligations in situations such as these, the Company cannot determine if and to what extent the insurance policy will cover the ongoing legal fees for this matter. Accordingly, the legal fees that may be incurred by the Company in defending this former officer could have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operation.

Swiss Bribery Matter

In August 2013, the Company's former Swiss subsidiary was served with a search warrant from the Swiss federal prosecutor's office. At the end of the search, the Swiss federal prosecutor presented the Company with a listing of the materials gathered by the representatives and then removed the materials from its premises for keeping at the prosecutor's office. Based upon the Company's exposure to the case, the Company believes this action to be related to the same or similar facts and circumstances as the FCPA action previously settled with the SEC and the DOJ. During initial discussions, the Swiss prosecutor has acknowledged both the existence of the Company's deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ and its cooperation efforts thereunder, both of which should have a positive impact on discussions going forward. Additionally, other than the activities previously reviewed in conjunction with the SEC and DOJ matters under the FCPA, the Company has no reason to believe that additional facts or circumstances are under review by the Swiss authorities. In December 2018, the Company sold its Swiss subsidiary as part of the sale of its high voltage product line and agreed to indemnify, within certain parameters, the purchaser for damages which may arise from this matter. To date, the Swiss prosecutor has not issued its formal decision as to whether the charges will be brought against individuals or the Company or whether the proceeding will be abandoned. At this stage in the investigation, the Company is currently unable to determine the extent to which it will be subject to fines in accordance with Swiss bribery laws and what additional expenses will be incurred in order to defend this matter. As such, the Company cannot determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that a loss will be incurred nor can it estimate the range of any such potential loss. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued an amount for any potential loss associated with this action, but an adverse result could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operation.

Government Investigations

In early 2013, the Company voluntarily provided information to the SEC and the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California related to its announcement that it intended to file restated financial statements for fiscal years 2011 and 2012. On June 11, 2015 and June 16, 2016, the Company received subpoenas from the SEC requesting certain documents related to, among other things, the facts and circumstances surrounding the restated financial statements. The Company has provided documents and information to the SEC in response to the subpoenas. In March 2018, the Company consented to an order filed by the SEC without admitting or denying the SEC's findings thereby resolving alleged violations of certain anti-fraud and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws and related rules. Under the terms of the order, the Company was required to pay $2.8 million in a civil penalty and agreed not to commit or cause any violations of certain anti-fraud and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws and related rules. The Company had previously accrued this amount owed as an operating expense in its financial statements in the third quarter of 2017 and paid the amount in full in April 2018. Under the terms of the order, the Company also agreed to certain undertakings related to revenue recognition policies and procedures, including two reporting requirements and a certification of compliance with the undertakings. In April 2019, the Company received confirmation from the SEC that the undertakings set forth in the order are deemed satisfied.

Note 15 - Merger Agreement with Tesla

On February 3, 2019, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") with Tesla, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Tesla"") and Cambria Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Tesla (""Merger Sub""), which contemplates the acquisition of the Company by Tesla, through Merger Sub. The Merger Agreement requires that Tesla commence an all stock exchange offer for all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company (the ""Offer""), followed by a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company pursuant to which the Company will survive as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tesla (the ""Merger"").

The first step is to confirm whether the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Davis Rodden v. Steven Bilodeau, et al., Case No. 2019-0176"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the section ""Stockholder Litigation"". Therefore, the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit. Therefore, the answer to the first question is ""No"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since the first question's answer is ""No"", I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement or MOU related to the Target Case. 

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

VERIFIED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT

Plaintiff Davis Rodden (""Plaintiff""), on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated public stockholders of Maxwell Technologies, Inc. (""Maxwell or the ""Company""), brings the following Verified Class Action Complaint (the ""Complaint"") against the members of the board of directors of Maxwell (the ""Maxwell Board"") for breaching their fiduciary duties. The allegations of the Complaint are based on the knowledge of Plaintiff as to himself, and on information and belief, including the investigation of counsel and review of publicly available information, as to all other matters.

INTRODUCTION

1. This action arises from breaches of fiduciary duty by the Maxwell Board in connection with the filing of a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement (the ""Solicitation/Recommendation Statement"") on Schedule 14D-9 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") on February 20, 2019.

2. The Solicitation/Recommendation Statement relates to an exchange offer by Cambria Acquisition Corp. (the ""Offeror""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tesla, Inc. (collectively referred to herein with the Offeror as ""Tesla""), as disclosed in a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO filed by Tesla with the SEC on February 20, 2019, pursuant to which Tesla is offering to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Maxwell common stock (the ""Offer"").

3. Each Maxwell stockholder who participates in the Offer will receive, for each share of Maxwell common stock validly tendered and not withdrawn:

shares of Tesla Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share (""Tesla Common Stock""), equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $4.75 by the volume weighted average of the daily volume weighted average of the trading price of one (1) share of Tesla common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market for the five (5) consecutive trading days ending on and including the second trading day immediately preceding the expiration of the Offer (the ""Tesla Trading Price""), subject to the minimum, together with cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Tesla Common Stock (the ""Offer Consideration""), without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. In the event that the Tesla Trading Price is equal to or less than $245.90, the minimum will apply and each share of Maxwell Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn will be exchanged for 0.0193 of a share of Tesla Common Stock.

4. The Offer is being made pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") dated February 3, 2019 between Maxwell and Tesla. According to the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement, Tesla commenced the Offer on February 20, 2019, and the Offer will expire on March 19, 2019 (subject to extension in certain circumstances).

5. Further according to the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement, following the completion of the Offer the Offeror will be merged with and into Maxwell, with Maxwell surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tesla through a merger (the ""Merger"") effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In the Merger, each then-outstanding share of Maxwell common stock (other than shares of Maxwell common stock held in treasury, by Tesla or Maxwell or their respective subsidiaries) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Offer Consideration.1

6. The Solicitation/Recommendation Statement fails to disclose patently material information to Maxwell stockholders about Barclays Capital Inc. (""Barclays""), the sole financial advisor engaged by Maxwell in connection with the Proposed Transaction. Specifically, the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement fails to disclose to Maxwell stockholders the financial compensation that Barclays has received from each of Maxwell and Tesla through recent financial advisory engagements outside of the Proposed Transaction.

1 | The Offer and Merger are collectively referred to herein as the ""Proposed Transaction.""

7. This omitted information is patently material because it is imperative for Maxwell stockholders to be able to understand what factors might have influenced Barclays' analytical efforts in providing a fairness opinion concerning the Proposed Transaction and the Offer Consideration. In order to fairly assess the Proposed Transaction and determine how to respond to the Offer, and to assess whether to rely on Barclays' fairness opinion in making those decisions, Maxwell stockholders, such as Plaintiff, are entitled to know all material information concerning Barclays' conflicts of interest with respect to the Proposed Transaction. Maxwell stockholders would find the information concerning Barclays' conflicts of interest material in determining how to respond to the Offer.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Davis Rodden v. Steven Bilodeau, et al., Case No. 2019-0176. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit (a)(5)(J)* as ""Class Action Complaint filed on March 4, 2019 (Davis Rodden v. Steven Bilodeau, et al., Case No. 2019-0176)"". Therefore, the case is mentioned in the filing.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any implied agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my review, I did not find any supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

""On March 7, 2019, the FCO notified Tesla that the merger has been cleared by the FCO in accordance with the German ARC. Accordingly, the condition to the Offer and the Merger that any waiting period under the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated and any clearance required pursuant to the German ARC has been satisfied.""

Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by adding a subsection immediately following the subsection entitled ""Stockholder Approval Not Required,"" which new subsection is entitled ""Legal Proceedings - Stockholder Litigation"" and under such subsection, adding the following paragraphs:

""In connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, eight purported class action lawsuits have been filed. Five complaints, captioned Kip Leggett v.

Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et. al, Case No. 3:19-cv-00451 (filed March 7, 2019) were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. One complaint, captioned John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00448 (filed March 4, 2019), was filed in the United States District Court District of Delaware. One complaint, captioned Davis Rodden v. Steven Bilodeau, et al,. Case No. 2019-0176 (filed March 4, 2019), was filed in the Delaware Chancery Court. One complaint, captioned Jack Phillipps v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al,. Case No. 1:19-cv-01927 (filed February 28, 2019), was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

In general, the complaints assert claims against the Company and the Company's Board, with Tesla and the Offeror as additional defendants in the Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al. and John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al. complaints. The complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants failed to make adequate disclosures in the Schedule 14D-9 filed by Maxwell Technologies on February 20, 2019. The complaints seek, among other things, to enjoin the proposed transaction, rescission of the proposed transaction should it be completed, and other equitable relief.

The Company believes the respective allegations against it in these complaints lack merit, and the Company intends to vigorously defend the actions.

The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complaints which are attached to the Schedule TO as Exhibit (a)(5)(D), Exhibit (a)(5)(E), Exhibit (a)(5)(F), Exhibit (a)(5)(G), Exhibit (a)(5)(H), Exhibit (a)(5)(I), Exhibit (a)(5)(J) and Exhibit (a)(5)(K), respectively.""

Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 and the disclosure under the first sentence of the subsection entitled ""Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" is hereby amended and restated as follows:

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00448"" filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following paragraph:

""One complaint, captioned John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00448 (filed March 4, 2019), was filed in the United States District Court District of Delaware.""

Therefore, the Target Case is mentioned in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the Company has made an amendment to the Schedule 14D-9, which includes adding a subsection entitled ""Legal Proceedings - Stockholder Litigation"". However, there is no explicit mention that this amendment is in response to the lawsuit. 

Therefore, the answer to ""supplemental_disclosure"" is ""No"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since the answer to ""supplemental_disclosure"" is ""No"", I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will check if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since no agreement was found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, the final answer is:

{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00448 (filed March 4, 2019)"" in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the Target Case is mentioned in the following paragraph:

""One complaint, captioned John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00448 (filed March 4, 2019), was filed in the United States District Court District of Delaware.""

Therefore, the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the Company made an amendment to the Schedule 14D-9, which includes adding a subsection entitled ""Legal Proceedings - Stockholder Litigation"". However, I did not find any explicit mention that the supplemental disclosure is in response to the Target Case lawsuit.

Although the Company made an amendment, it is not clear if it is in response to the Target Case lawsuit. Therefore, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any valid supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00448"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the passage: ""Two complaints, captioned John Solak v.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit. Therefore, the answer to ""supplemental_disclosure"" is ""No"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since the answer to ""supplemental_disclosure"" is ""No"", I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

Stockholder Litigation

In connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, nine purported class action lawsuits have been filed. Five complaints, captioned Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00377 (filed February 26, 2019), Shiva Stein v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00395 (filed February 26, 2019), Joel Rosenfeld IRA v.

Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et. al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00451 (filed March 7, 2019) were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. Two complaints, captioned John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00448 (filed March 4, 2019) and Sabatini v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00443 (filed March 1, 2019), were filed in the United States District Court District of Delaware. One complaint, captioned Davis Rodden v. Steven Bilodeau, et al., Case No. 2019-0176 (filed March 4, 2019), was filed in the Delaware Chancery Court and was voluntarily dismissed on April 3, 2019. One complaint, captioned Jack Phillipps v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01927 (filed February 28, 2019), was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

In general, the complaints assert claims against the Company and the Company's Board, with Tesla and Cambria Acquisition Corp. and as additional defendants in the Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Sabatini v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., and John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al. complaints. The complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants failed to make adequate disclosures in the Schedule 14D-9 filed by Maxwell Technologies on February 20, 2019. The complaints seek, among other things, to enjoin the proposed transaction, rescission of the proposed transaction should it be completed, and other equitable relief. The Company believes the respective allegations against it in these complaints lack merit, and the Company intends to vigorously defend the actions. As such, the Company cannot determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that a loss will be incurred nor can it estimate the range of any such potential loss. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued an amount for any potential loss associated with this action, but an adverse result could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operation.

FCPA Matter

In January 2011, the Company reached settlements with the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ"") with respect to charges asserted by the SEC and DOJ relating to the anti-bribery, books and records, internal controls, and disclosure provisions of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"") and other securities laws violations. The Company paid the monetary penalties under these settlements in installments such that all monetary penalties were paid in full by January 2013. With respect to the DOJ charges, a judgment of dismissal was issued in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California on March 28, 2014.

On October 15, 2013, the Company received an informal notice from the DOJ that an indictment against the former Senior Vice President and General Manager of its Swiss subsidiary had been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. The indictment is against the individual, a former officer, and not against the Company and the Company does not foresee that further penalties or fines could be assessed against it as a corporate entity for this matter. However, the Company may be required throughout the term of the action to advance the legal fees and costs incurred by the individual defendant and to incur other financial obligations. While the Company maintains directors' and officers' insurance policies which are intended to cover legal expenses related to its indemnification obligations in situations such as these, the Company cannot determine if and to what extent the insurance policy will cover the ongoing legal fees for this matter. Accordingly, the legal fees that may be incurred by the Company in defending this former officer could have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operation.

Swiss Bribery Matter

In August 2013, the Company's former Swiss subsidiary was served with a search warrant from the Swiss federal prosecutor's office. At the end of the search, the Swiss federal prosecutor presented the Company with a listing of the materials gathered by the representatives and then removed the materials from its premises for keeping at the prosecutor's office. Based upon the Company's exposure to the case, the Company believes this action to be related to the same or similar facts and circumstances as the FCPA action previously settled with the SEC and the DOJ. During initial discussions, the Swiss prosecutor has acknowledged both the existence of the Company's deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ and its cooperation efforts thereunder, both of which should have a positive impact on discussions going forward. Additionally, other than the activities previously reviewed in conjunction with the SEC and DOJ matters under the FCPA, the Company has no reason to believe that additional facts or circumstances are under review by the Swiss authorities. In December 2018, the Company sold its Swiss subsidiary as part of the sale of its high voltage product line and agreed to indemnify, within certain parameters, the purchaser for damages which may arise from this matter. To date, the Swiss prosecutor has not issued its formal decision as to whether the charges will be brought against individuals or the Company or whether the proceeding will be abandoned. At this stage in the investigation, the Company is currently unable to determine the extent to which it will be subject to fines in accordance with Swiss bribery laws and what additional expenses will be incurred in order to defend this matter. As such, the Company cannot determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that a loss will be incurred nor can it estimate the range of any such potential loss. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued an amount for any potential loss associated with this action, but an adverse result could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operation.

Government Investigations

In early 2013, the Company voluntarily provided information to the SEC and the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California related to its announcement that it intended to file restated financial statements for fiscal years 2011 and 2012. On June 11, 2015 and June 16, 2016, the Company received subpoenas from the SEC requesting certain documents related to, among other things, the facts and circumstances surrounding the restated financial statements. The Company has provided documents and information to the SEC in response to the subpoenas. In March 2018, the Company consented to an order filed by the SEC without admitting or denying the SEC's findings thereby resolving alleged violations of certain anti-fraud and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws and related rules. Under the terms of the order, the Company was required to pay $2.8 million in a civil penalty and agreed not to commit or cause any violations of certain anti-fraud and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws and related rules. The Company had previously accrued this amount owed as an operating expense in its financial statements in the third quarter of 2017 and paid the amount in full in April 2018. Under the terms of the order, the Company also agreed to certain undertakings related to revenue recognition policies and procedures, including two reporting requirements and a certification of compliance with the undertakings. In April 2019, the Company received confirmation from the SEC that the undertakings set forth in the order are deemed satisfied.

Note 15 - Merger Agreement with Tesla

On February 3, 2019, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") with Tesla, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Tesla"") and Cambria Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Tesla (""Merger Sub""), which contemplates the acquisition of the Company by Tesla, through Merger Sub. The Merger Agreement requires that Tesla commence an all stock exchange offer for all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company (the ""Offer""), followed by a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company pursuant to which the Company will survive as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tesla (the ""Merger"").

Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00448 (filed March 4, 2019)"" filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the section ""Stockholder Litigation"" as one of the nine purported class action lawsuits filed in connection with the merger agreement.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

On October 15, 2013, the Company received an informal notice from the DOJ that an indictment against the former Senior Vice President and General Manager of its Swiss subsidiary had been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. The indictment is against the individual, a former officer, and not against the Company and the Company does not foresee that further penalties or fines could be assessed against it as a corporate entity for this matter. However, the Company may be required throughout the term of the action to advance the legal fees and costs incurred by the individual defendant and to incur other financial obligations. While the Company maintains directors' and officers' insurance policies which are intended to cover legal expenses related to its indemnification obligations in situations such as these, the Company cannot determine if and to what extent the insurance policy will cover the ongoing legal fees for this matter. Accordingly, the legal fees that may be incurred by the Company in defending this former officer could have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operation.

Swiss Bribery Matter

In August 2013, the Company's former Swiss subsidiary was served with a search warrant from the Swiss federal prosecutor's office. At the end of the search, the Swiss federal prosecutor presented the Company with a listing of the materials gathered by the representatives and then removed the materials from its premises for keeping at the prosecutor's office. Based upon the Company's exposure to the case, the Company believes this action to be related to the same or similar facts and circumstances as the FCPA action previously settled with the SEC and the DOJ. During initial discussions, the Swiss prosecutor has acknowledged both the existence of the Company's deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ and its cooperation efforts thereunder, both of which should have a positive impact on discussions going forward. Additionally, other than the activities previously reviewed in conjunction with the SEC and DOJ matters under the FCPA, the Company has no reason to believe that additional facts or circumstances are under review by the Swiss authorities. In December 2018, the Company sold its Swiss subsidiary as part of the sale of its high voltage product line and agreed to indemnify, within certain parameters, the purchaser for damages which may arise from this matter. To date, the Swiss prosecutor has not issued its formal decision as to whether the charges will be brought against individuals or the Company or whether the proceeding will be abandoned. At this stage in the investigation, the Company is currently unable to determine the extent to which it will be subject to fines in accordance with Swiss bribery laws and what additional expenses will be incurred in order to defend this matter. As such, the Company cannot determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that a loss will be incurred nor can it estimate the range of any such potential loss. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued an amount for any potential loss associated with this action, but an adverse result could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operation.

Government Investigations

In early 2013, the Company voluntarily provided information to the SEC and the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California related to its announcement that it intended to file restated financial statements for fiscal years 2011 and 2012. On June 11, 2015 and June 16, 2016, the Company received subpoenas from the SEC requesting certain documents related to, among other things, the facts and circumstances surrounding the restated financial statements. The Company has provided documents and information to the SEC in response to the subpoenas. In March 2018, the Company consented to an order filed by the SEC without admitting or denying the SEC's findings thereby resolving alleged violations of certain anti-fraud and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws and related rules. Under the terms of the order, the Company was required to pay $2.8 million in a civil penalty and agreed not to commit or cause any violations of certain anti-fraud and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws and related rules. The Company had previously accrued this amount owed as an operating expense in its financial statements in the third quarter of 2017 and paid the amount in full in April 2018. Under the terms of the order, the Company also agreed to certain undertakings related to revenue recognition policies and procedures, including two reporting requirements and a certification of compliance with the undertakings. In April 2019, the Company received confirmation from the SEC that the undertakings set forth in the order are deemed satisfied.

Note 15 - Merger Agreement with Tesla

On February 3, 2019, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") with Tesla, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Tesla"") and Cambria Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Tesla (""Merger Sub""), which contemplates the acquisition of the Company by Tesla, through Merger Sub. The Merger Agreement requires that Tesla commence an all stock exchange offer for all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company (the ""Offer""), followed by a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company pursuant to which the Company will survive as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tesla (the ""Merger"").

In the Offer, each Company stockholder who elects to participate in the Offer will receive a fractional share of common stock of Tesla (""Tesla Common Stock"") for each share of Company common stock (""Company Common Stock"") exchanged in the Offer. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than four (4) business days following the date on which Tesla files its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018), Tesla will commence the Offer to purchase each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock for a fraction of a share of Tesla Common Stock, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $4.75 by the volume weighted average closing sale price of one (1) share of Tesla Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (""NASDAQ"") for the five (5) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the second trading day prior to the date of the expiration of the Offer (the ""Tesla Trading Price""). However, in the event that the Tesla Trading Price is equal to or less than $245.90, then each share of Company Common Stock shall be exchanged for 0.0193 of a share of Tesla Common Stock. Such shares of Tesla Common Stock, plus any cash paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Tesla Common Stock, is referred to as the ""Offer Consideration"".

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00448 (filed March 4, 2019)"" filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the Target Case is mentioned in the section ""Stockholder Litigation"" as one of the nine purported class action lawsuits filed in connection with the merger agreement.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will check if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. However, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my review, I did not find any evidence of supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

Plaintiff John Solak (""Plaintiff""), by his undersigned attorneys, for this complaint against defendants, alleges upon personal knowledge with respect to himself, and upon information and belief based upon, inter alia, the investigation of counsel as to all other allegations herein, as follows:

SUMMARY OF THE ACTION

1. Plaintiff brings this stockholder class action on behalf of himself and all other public stockholders of Maxwell Technologies, Inc. (""Maxwell"" or the ""Company"") alleging violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") and for breaches of fiduciary duty.

2. The action arises out of a proposed tender offer, which was announced on February 4, 2019, pursuant to which Maxwell will be acquired by Tesla, Inc. (""Parent"") and Cambria Acquisition Corporation (""Merger Sub,"" and together with Parent, ""Tesla"") in a deal valued at approximately $218 million (the ""Proposed Transaction""). The tender offer is set to expire on March 19, 2019 at 11:59pm and in a stock for stock exchange.

3. The terms of the Proposed Transaction were disclosed to stockholders in a February 4, 2019, filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") on Form 8-K attaching the definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"").

4. The Merger Agreement provides that Maxwell will become an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Tesla, and Maxwell stockholders will receive shares of Tesla common stock valued at approximately $4.50 for each share of Maxwell common stock they own. The Merger Agreement further provides that the exact valuation will be based upon the quotient obtained by dividing $4.75 by a volume weighted average price of one share of Tesla common stock for the five consecutive trading days preceding the expiration of the tender offer period, rounded to four decimal places.

5. As required under the securities laws, on February 20, 2019, Maxwell filed a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (the ""14D-9"") with the SEC in support of the Proposed Transaction, which included certain financial information concerning the Company and the process leading up to the Proposed Transaction.

6. On the same day, Tesla filed a Registration Statement on Schedule S-4 (the ""S-4,"" together with the ""14D-9"" the ""Proxy Materials"") with the SEC in support of the Proposed Transaction.

7. The Proposed Transaction is unfair to Maxwell shareholders for myriad reasons. First, the 14D-9 details how the ""sales process"" was done hastily, and that the Board was focused on selling the Company only to Tesla.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Plaintiff John Solak (""Plaintiff""), by his undersigned attorneys, for this complaint against defendants, alleges upon personal knowledge with respect to himself, and upon information and belief based upon, inter alia, the investigation of counsel as to all other allegations herein, as follows:

SUMMARY OF THE ACTION

1. Plaintiff brings this stockholder class action on behalf of himself and all other public stockholders of Maxwell Technologies, Inc.

2. The action arises out of a proposed tender offer, which was announced on February 4, 2019, pursuant to which Maxwell will be acquired by Tesla, Inc.

The tender offer is set to expire on March 19, 2019 at 11:59pm and in a stock for stock exchange.

3. The terms of the Proposed Transaction were disclosed to stockholders in a February 4, 2019, filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") on Form 8-K attaching the definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"").

4. The Merger Agreement provides that Maxwell will become an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Tesla, and Maxwell stockholders will receive shares of Tesla common stock valued at approximately $4.50 for each share of Maxwell common stock they own. The Merger Agreement further provides that the exact valuation will be based upon the quotient obtained by dividing $4.75 by a volume weighted average price of one share of Tesla common stock for the five consecutive trading days preceding the expiration of the tender offer period, rounded to four decimal places.

5. As required under the securities laws, on February 20, 2019, Maxwell filed a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (the ""14D-9"") with the SEC in support of the Proposed Transaction, which included certain financial information concerning the Company and the process leading up to the Proposed Transaction.

6. On the same day, Tesla filed a Registration Statement on Schedule S-4 (the ""S-4,"" together with the ""14D-9"" the ""Proxy Materials"") with the SEC in support of the Proposed Transaction.

7. The Proposed Transaction is unfair to Maxwell shareholders for myriad reasons. First, the 14D-9 details how the ""sales process"" was done hastily, and that the Board was focused on selling the Company only to Tesla.

8. Second, traditional fiduciary measures - such as a special committee and market checks - were undertaken only after Tesla had made several bids and went so far as to threaten to end its customer relationship with Maxwell should the Company not accept its offer to purchase it on Tesla's terms.

9. Third, it appears that the Proposed Transaction was structured to benefit the Board and senior management by allowing them to receive significant and immediate benefits. Certain Directors and other insiders will be the recipients of lucrative change-in-control agreements, triggered upon the termination of their employment as a consequence of the consummation of the Proposed Transaction.

</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al."" with case number 1:19-cv-00448. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the table under Item 12, Exhibits, specifically in section (a)(5)(I)* as ""Class Action Complaint filed on March 4, 2019 (John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00448)"". Therefore, the Target Case is mentioned in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since the Target Case is mentioned, the next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

Since no explicit agreement was found, the next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since no agreement was found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the review of the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

""On March 7, 2019, the FCO notified Tesla that the merger has been cleared by the FCO in accordance with the German ARC. Accordingly, the condition to the Offer and the Merger that any waiting period under the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated and any clearance required pursuant to the German ARC has been satisfied.""

Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by adding a subsection immediately following the subsection entitled ""Stockholder Approval Not Required,"" which new subsection is entitled ""Legal Proceedings - Stockholder Litigation"" and under such subsection, adding the following paragraphs:

""In connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, eight purported class action lawsuits have been filed. Five complaints, captioned Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00377 (filed February 26, 2019), Shiva Stein v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00395 (filed February 26, 2019), Joel Rosenfeld IRA v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al,. Case No. 3:19-cv-00413 (filed March 1, 2019), Franck Prissert v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00429 (filed March 4, 2019) and Jonathan Mantak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et. al, Case No. 3:19-cv-00451 (filed March 7, 2019) were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. One complaint, captioned John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00448 (filed March 4, 2019), was filed in the United States District Court District of Delaware. One complaint, captioned Davis Rodden v. Steven Bilodeau, et al,. Case No. 2019-0176 (filed March 4, 2019), was filed in the Delaware Chancery Court. One complaint, captioned Jack Phillipps v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al,. Case No. 1:19-cv-01927 (filed February 28, 2019), was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

In general, the complaints assert claims against the Company and the Company's Board, with Tesla and the Offeror as additional defendants in the Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al. and John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al. complaints. The complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants failed to make adequate disclosures in the Schedule 14D-9 filed by Maxwell Technologies on February 20, 2019. The complaints seek, among other things, to enjoin the proposed transaction, rescission of the proposed transaction should it be completed, and other equitable relief.

The Company believes the respective allegations against it in these complaints lack merit, and the Company intends to vigorously defend the actions.

The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complaints which are attached to the Schedule TO as Exhibit (a)(5)(D), Exhibit (a)(5)(E), Exhibit (a)(5)(F), Exhibit (a)(5)(G), Exhibit (a)(5)(H), Exhibit (a)(5)(I), Exhibit (a)(5)(J) and Exhibit (a)(5)(K), respectively.""

Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 and the disclosure under the first sentence of the subsection entitled ""Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" is hereby amended and restated as follows:

""Information both included and incorporated by reference in this document may contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.""

- **case filing date**: 2019-03-04
- **case count**: United States District Court for the Southern District of California
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Franck Prissert v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00429. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following paragraph:

""One complaint, captioned Franck Prissert v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00429 (filed March 4, 2019) were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California.""

This confirms that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that there is no explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

However, I found that the Company has amended and supplemented the Schedule 14D-9 by adding a subsection entitled ""Legal Proceedings - Stockholder Litigation"". This suggests that the Company has made some kind of disclosure, but it is not clear if it is in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that there is no explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""Settlement Agreement"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that there is no explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that there is no strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since no agreement was found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Company did not make any supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit. Additionally, there is no explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Franck Prissert v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00429. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the subsection ""Legal Proceedings - Stockholder Litigation"". Therefore, the Target Case is discussed in the filing.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. Therefore, the answer to the first question is ""No"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since the first question's answer is ""No"", I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement for the Target Case. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

Although the Company expects to incur legal fees in connection with the below legal proceedings, the Company is unable to estimate the amount of such legal fees and therefore, such fees will be expensed in the period the legal services are performed.

Stockholder Litigation

In connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, nine purported class action lawsuits have been filed. Five complaints, captioned Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00377 (filed February 26, 2019), Shiva Stein v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00395 (filed February 26, 2019), Joel Rosenfeld IRA v.

Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et. al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00451 (filed March 7, 2019) were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. Two complaints, captioned John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00448 (filed March 4, 2019) and Sabatini v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00443 (filed March 1, 2019), were filed in the United States District Court District of Delaware. One complaint, captioned Davis Rodden v. Steven Bilodeau, et al., Case No. 2019-0176 (filed March 4, 2019), was filed in the Delaware Chancery Court and was voluntarily dismissed on April 3, 2019. One complaint, captioned Jack Phillipps v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01927 (filed February 28, 2019), was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

In general, the complaints assert claims against the Company and the Company's Board, with Tesla and Cambria Acquisition Corp. and as additional defendants in the Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Sabatini v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., and John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al. complaints. The complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants failed to make adequate disclosures in the Schedule 14D-9 filed by Maxwell Technologies on February 20, 2019. The complaints seek, among other things, to enjoin the proposed transaction, rescission of the proposed transaction should it be completed, and other equitable relief. The Company believes the respective allegations against it in these complaints lack merit, and the Company intends to vigorously defend the actions. As such, the Company cannot determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that a loss will be incurred nor can it estimate the range of any such potential loss. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued an amount for any potential loss associated with this action, but an adverse result could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operation.

FCPA Matter

In January 2011, the Company reached settlements with the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ"") with respect to charges asserted by the SEC and DOJ relating to the anti-bribery, books and records, internal controls, and disclosure provisions of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"") and other securities laws violations. The Company paid the monetary penalties under these settlements in installments such that all monetary penalties were paid in full by January 2013. With respect to the DOJ charges, a judgment of dismissal was issued in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California on March 28, 2014.

On October 15, 2013, the Company received an informal notice from the DOJ that an indictment against the former Senior Vice President and General Manager of its Swiss subsidiary had been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. The indictment is against the individual, a former officer, and not against the Company and the Company does not foresee that further penalties or fines could be assessed against it as a corporate entity for this matter. However, the Company may be required throughout the term of the action to advance the legal fees and costs incurred by the individual defendant and to incur other financial obligations. While the Company maintains directors' and officers' insurance policies which are intended to cover legal expenses related to its indemnification obligations in situations such as these, the Company cannot determine if and to what extent the insurance policy will cover the ongoing legal fees for this matter. Accordingly, the legal fees that may be incurred by the Company in defending this former officer could have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operation.

Swiss Bribery Matter

In August 2013, the Company's former Swiss subsidiary was served with a search warrant from the Swiss federal prosecutor's office. At the end of the search, the Swiss federal prosecutor presented the Company with a listing of the materials gathered by the representatives and then removed the materials from its premises for keeping at the prosecutor's office. Based upon the Company's exposure to the case, the Company believes this action to be related to the same or similar facts and circumstances as the FCPA action previously settled with the SEC and the DOJ. During initial discussions, the Swiss prosecutor has acknowledged both the existence of the Company's deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ and its cooperation efforts thereunder, both of which should have a positive impact on discussions going forward. Additionally, other than the activities previously reviewed in conjunction with the SEC and DOJ matters under the FCPA, the Company has no reason to believe that additional facts or circumstances are under review by the Swiss authorities. In December 2018, the Company sold its Swiss subsidiary as part of the sale of its high voltage product line and agreed to indemnify, within certain parameters, the purchaser for damages which may arise from this matter. To date, the Swiss prosecutor has not issued its formal decision as to whether the charges will be brought against individuals or the Company or whether the proceeding will be abandoned. At this stage in the investigation, the Company is currently unable to determine the extent to which it will be subject to fines in accordance with Swiss bribery laws and what additional expenses will be incurred in order to defend this matter. As such, the Company cannot determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that a loss will be incurred nor can it estimate the range of any such potential loss. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued an amount for any potential loss associated with this action, but an adverse result could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operation.

Government Investigations

In early 2013, the Company voluntarily provided information to the SEC and the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California related to its announcement that it intended to file restated financial statements for fiscal years 2011 and 2012. On June 11, 2015 and June 16, 2016, the Company received subpoenas from the SEC requesting certain documents related to, among other things, the facts and circumstances surrounding the restated financial statements. The Company has provided documents and information to the SEC in response to the subpoenas. In March 2018, the Company consented to an order filed by the SEC without admitting or denying the SEC's findings thereby resolving alleged violations of certain anti-fraud and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws and related rules. Under the terms of the order, the Company was required to pay $2.8 million in a civil penalty and agreed not to commit or cause any violations of certain anti-fraud and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws and related rules. The Company had previously accrued this amount owed as an operating expense in its financial statements in the third quarter of 2017 and paid the amount in full in April 2018. Under the terms of the order, the Company also agreed to certain undertakings related to revenue recognition policies and procedures, including two reporting requirements and a certification of compliance with the undertakings. In April 2019, the Company received confirmation from the SEC that the undertakings set forth in the order are deemed satisfied.

Note 15 - Merger Agreement with Tesla

On February 3, 2019, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") with Tesla, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Tesla"") and Cambria Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Tesla (""Merger Sub""), which contemplates the acquisition of the Company by Tesla, through Merger Sub. The Merger Agreement requires that Tesla commence an all stock exchange offer for all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company (the ""Offer""), followed by a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company pursuant to which the Company will survive as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tesla (the ""Merger"").

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Plaintiff Franck Prissert (""Plaintiff""), by his undersigned attorneys, alleges upon personal knowledge with respect to himself, and upon information and belief based upon, inter alia, the investigation of counsel as to all other allegations herein, as follows:

NATURE OF THE ACTION

1. This action is brought by Plaintiff against Maxwell Technologies, Inc. (""Maxwell"" or the ""Company"") and the members of the Company's board of directors (collectively, the ""Board"" or ""Individual Defendants,"" and, together with Maxwell, the ""Defendants"") for their violations of Sections 14(e) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act""), 15 U.S.C. ยงยง 78n(e) and 78t(a) in connection with the tender offer (""Tender Offer"") by Tesla, Inc., through its subsidiary Cambria Acquisition Corp. (collectively ""Tesla""), to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Maxwell (the ""Proposed Merger"").

2. On February 3, 2019, Maxwell entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the ""Merger Agreement""), whereby shareholders of Maxwell common stock will receive shares of Tesla common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $4.75 by the volume weighted average of the daily volume weighted average of the trading price of one (1) share of Tesla common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market for the five (5) consecutive trading days ending on and including the second trading day immediately preceding the expiration of the Tender Offer in exchange for each share of Maxwell stock they own (the ""Merger Consideration"").

3. On February 20, 2019, in order to convince Maxwell shareholders to tender their shares, the Board authorized the filing of a materially incomplete and misleading Schedule 14D-9 Solicitation/Recommendation Statement (the ""Recommendation Statement"") with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""). In particular, the Recommendation Statement contains materially incomplete and misleading information concerning: (i) the valuation of Tesla and the Merger Consideration; (ii) the valuation analyses performed by the Company's financial advisor, Barclays Capital Inc. (""Barclays""); (iii) the Maxwell financial projections; and (iv) the conflicts of interest faced by Barclays.

4. The Tender Offer is scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on March 19, 2019 (the ""Expiration Date""). It is imperative that the material information that has been omitted from the Recommendation Statement is disclosed to the Company's shareholders prior to the forthcoming Expiration Date so they may make an informed determination on whether to tender their shares.

5. For these reasons, and as set forth in detail herein, Plaintiff seeks to enjoin Defendants from closing the Tender Offer or taking any steps to consummate the Proposed Merger, unless and until the material information discussed below is disclosed to Maxwell shareholders or, in the event the Proposed Merger is consummated, to recover damages resulting from the Defendants' violations of the Exchange Act.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

6. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. ยง 78aa) and 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 (federal question jurisdiction) as Plaintiff alleges violations of Section 14(e) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act.

7. The Court has personal jurisdiction over each of the Defendants because each conducts business in and maintains operations in this District or is an individual who either is present in this District for jurisdictional purposes or has sufficient minimum contacts with this District as to render the exercise of jurisdiction by this Court permissible under traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.

</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Franck Prissert v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00429"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the table under Item 12, Exhibits, specifically in the section (a)(5)(G)*, which lists the Class Action Complaint filed on March 4, 2019, with the case number 3:19-cv-00429. This confirms that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I did not find any evidence of supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the Merger, including the requirement to divest assets, or require changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement. These conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the Merger not being satisfied.

On March 7, 2019, Shiva Stein, a purported stockholder of Ellie Mae, filed a putative class action complaint against Ellie Mae and our Board of Directors in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (the ""California District Court""), captioned Shiva Stein v.

The complaint filed by Shiva Stein (the ""Stein Complaint"") alleges that (a) Ellie Mae and our Board of Directors violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and 17 C.F.R. ยง 244.100 promulgated thereunder, by filing this Proxy Statement, which allegedly fails to disclose and/or misrepresents material information about the Merger, (b) Ellie Mae and our Board of Directors violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, by filing this Proxy Statement, which allegedly fails to disclose and/or misrepresents material information about the Merger, and (c) the members of our Board of Directors, as control persons of Ellie Mae, violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the filing of this allegedly materially deficient Proxy Statement. Shiva Stein has asked the California District Court to, among other things, (i) enjoin the defendants and all persons acting in concert with them from proceeding with, consummating, or closing the proposed transaction, (ii) rescind, to the extent already consummated, the proposed transaction, or grant the plaintiff recissory damages, (iii) award compensatory damages against the defendants in an amount to be determined at trial and (iv) award plaintiff the costs of the action, included reasonable allowance for plaintiff's counsel and experts' fees.

Ellie Mae, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00486-UNA. The complaint filed by Carole Epstein (the ""Epstein Complaint"") alleges that (a) Ellie Mae and our Board of Directors violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, by filing this Proxy Statement, which allegedly fails to disclose and/or misrepresents material information about the Merger and (b) the members of our Board of Directors, as control persons of Ellie Mae, violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the filing of this allegedly materially deficient Proxy Statement. Carole Epstein has asked the Delaware District Court to, among other things, (i) enjoin the defendants and all persons acting in concert with them from proceeding with, consummating, or closing the proposed transaction, (ii) rescind, to the extent already consummated, the proposed transaction, or grant the plaintiff recissory damages, (iii) direct the defendants to file a proxy statement that does not contain any untrue statements of material fact and states all material facts required to make the statements contained therein not misleading, (iv) declare that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder and (v) award plaintiff the costs of the action, included reasonable allowance for plaintiff's attorneys' and experts' fees.

Ellie Mae believes that the above described claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend both actions. Ellie Mae cannot predict the outcome of or estimate the possible loss or range of loss from either matter. It is possible that additional, similar complaints may be filed or the complaints described above will be amended. If this occurs, Ellie Mae does not intend to announce the filing of each additional, similar complaint or any amended complaint unless it contains allegations that are substantially distinct from those made in the pending actions described above.

PROPOSAL 1: ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following summary describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The descriptions of the Merger Agreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. You should carefully read and consider the entire Merger Agreement, which is the legal document that governs the Merger, because this summary may not contain all the information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.

The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement (1) were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; (2) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement; and (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by Ellie Mae, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between Ellie Mae, Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Stockholders are not third party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Ellie Mae, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Ellie Mae, Parent and Merger Sub, because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the Merger Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger Agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual information regarding Ellie Mae, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the Merger Agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in our filings with the SEC regarding Ellie Mae and our business.

Effects of the Merger; Directors and Officers; Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws

The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time: (1) Merger Sub will be merged with and into Ellie Mae, with Ellie Mae becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent; and (2) the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will thereupon cease. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will possess all properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Ellie Mae and Merger Sub, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of Ellie Mae and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

At the Effective Time, the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation will consist of the directors of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. At the Effective Time, the officers of Ellie Mae as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until their successors are duly appointed. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Ellie Mae as the Surviving Corporation will be amended to read substantially identically to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, will become the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Michael Kent v. Ellie Mae, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00473-UNA. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the section ""Litigation Relating to the Merger"". Therefore, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit. Therefore, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement related to the Target Case. Therefore, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

Stockholder Litigation

In connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, nine purported class action lawsuits have been filed. Five complaints, captioned Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00377 (filed February 26, 2019), Shiva Stein v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00395 (filed February 26, 2019), Joel Rosenfeld IRA v.

Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et. al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00451 (filed March 7, 2019) were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. Two complaints, captioned John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00448 (filed March 4, 2019) and Sabatini v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00443 (filed March 1, 2019), were filed in the United States District Court District of Delaware. One complaint, captioned Davis Rodden v. Steven Bilodeau, et al., Case No. 2019-0176 (filed March 4, 2019), was filed in the Delaware Chancery Court and was voluntarily dismissed on April 3, 2019. One complaint, captioned Jack Phillipps v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01927 (filed February 28, 2019), was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

In general, the complaints assert claims against the Company and the Company's Board, with Tesla and Cambria Acquisition Corp. and as additional defendants in the Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Sabatini v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., and John Solak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al. complaints. The complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants failed to make adequate disclosures in the Schedule 14D-9 filed by Maxwell Technologies on February 20, 2019. The complaints seek, among other things, to enjoin the proposed transaction, rescission of the proposed transaction should it be completed, and other equitable relief. The Company believes the respective allegations against it in these complaints lack merit, and the Company intends to vigorously defend the actions. As such, the Company cannot determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that a loss will be incurred nor can it estimate the range of any such potential loss. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued an amount for any potential loss associated with this action, but an adverse result could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operation.

FCPA Matter

In January 2011, the Company reached settlements with the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ"") with respect to charges asserted by the SEC and DOJ relating to the anti-bribery, books and records, internal controls, and disclosure provisions of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"") and other securities laws violations. The Company paid the monetary penalties under these settlements in installments such that all monetary penalties were paid in full by January 2013. With respect to the DOJ charges, a judgment of dismissal was issued in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California on March 28, 2014.

On October 15, 2013, the Company received an informal notice from the DOJ that an indictment against the former Senior Vice President and General Manager of its Swiss subsidiary had been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. The indictment is against the individual, a former officer, and not against the Company and the Company does not foresee that further penalties or fines could be assessed against it as a corporate entity for this matter. However, the Company may be required throughout the term of the action to advance the legal fees and costs incurred by the individual defendant and to incur other financial obligations. While the Company maintains directors' and officers' insurance policies which are intended to cover legal expenses related to its indemnification obligations in situations such as these, the Company cannot determine if and to what extent the insurance policy will cover the ongoing legal fees for this matter. Accordingly, the legal fees that may be incurred by the Company in defending this former officer could have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operation.

Swiss Bribery Matter

In August 2013, the Company's former Swiss subsidiary was served with a search warrant from the Swiss federal prosecutor's office. At the end of the search, the Swiss federal prosecutor presented the Company with a listing of the materials gathered by the representatives and then removed the materials from its premises for keeping at the prosecutor's office. Based upon the Company's exposure to the case, the Company believes this action to be related to the same or similar facts and circumstances as the FCPA action previously settled with the SEC and the DOJ. During initial discussions, the Swiss prosecutor has acknowledged both the existence of the Company's deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ and its cooperation efforts thereunder, both of which should have a positive impact on discussions going forward. Additionally, other than the activities previously reviewed in conjunction with the SEC and DOJ matters under the FCPA, the Company has no reason to believe that additional facts or circumstances are under review by the Swiss authorities. In December 2018, the Company sold its Swiss subsidiary as part of the sale of its high voltage product line and agreed to indemnify, within certain parameters, the purchaser for damages which may arise from this matter. To date, the Swiss prosecutor has not issued its formal decision as to whether the charges will be brought against individuals or the Company or whether the proceeding will be abandoned. At this stage in the investigation, the Company is currently unable to determine the extent to which it will be subject to fines in accordance with Swiss bribery laws and what additional expenses will be incurred in order to defend this matter. As such, the Company cannot determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that a loss will be incurred nor can it estimate the range of any such potential loss. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued an amount for any potential loss associated with this action, but an adverse result could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operation.

Government Investigations

In early 2013, the Company voluntarily provided information to the SEC and the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California related to its announcement that it intended to file restated financial statements for fiscal years 2011 and 2012. On June 11, 2015 and June 16, 2016, the Company received subpoenas from the SEC requesting certain documents related to, among other things, the facts and circumstances surrounding the restated financial statements. The Company has provided documents and information to the SEC in response to the subpoenas. In March 2018, the Company consented to an order filed by the SEC without admitting or denying the SEC's findings thereby resolving alleged violations of certain anti-fraud and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws and related rules. Under the terms of the order, the Company was required to pay $2.8 million in a civil penalty and agreed not to commit or cause any violations of certain anti-fraud and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws and related rules. The Company had previously accrued this amount owed as an operating expense in its financial statements in the third quarter of 2017 and paid the amount in full in April 2018. Under the terms of the order, the Company also agreed to certain undertakings related to revenue recognition policies and procedures, including two reporting requirements and a certification of compliance with the undertakings. In April 2019, the Company received confirmation from the SEC that the undertakings set forth in the order are deemed satisfied.

Note 15 - Merger Agreement with Tesla

On February 3, 2019, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") with Tesla, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Tesla"") and Cambria Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Tesla (""Merger Sub""), which contemplates the acquisition of the Company by Tesla, through Merger Sub. The Merger Agreement requires that Tesla commence an all stock exchange offer for all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company (the ""Offer""), followed by a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company pursuant to which the Company will survive as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tesla (the ""Merger"").

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Jonathan Mantak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00451 (filed March 7, 2019)"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the Target Case is mentioned in the section ""Stockholder Litigation"". Therefore, the Target Case is discussed in the filing.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since the Target Case is discussed, the next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement or MOU related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

Since no explicit agreement was found, the next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since no agreement was found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the review of the Filing Excerpts, I found that the Target Case is discussed, but there is no mention of supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Plaintiff Jonathan Mantak (""Plaintiff""), by and through his undersigned counsel, for his complaint against defendants, alleges upon personal knowledge with respect to himself, and upon information and belief based upon, inter alia, the investigation of counsel as to all other allegations herein, as follows:

NATURE OF THE ACTION

1. This is a class action brought on behalf of the public stockholders of Maxwell Technologies, Inc. (""Maxwell"" or the ""Company"") against Maxwell and the members of its Board of Directors (the ""Board"" or the ""Individual Defendants"") for their violations of Sections 14(e) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act""), 15 U.S.C. ยงยง 78n(e) and 78t(a) and to enjoin the expiration of a tender offer (the ""Tender Offer"") on a proposed transaction, pursuant to which Maxwell will be acquired by Tesla, Inc. (""Tesla"") through its wholly owned subsidiary Cambria Acquisition Corp. (""Offeror"") (the ""Proposed Transaction"").

2. On February 4, 2019, Maxwell issued a press release announcing that it had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") to sell Maxwell to Tesla. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, on February 20, 2019, Offeror commenced the Tender Offer to purchase all outstanding shares of Maxwell for $4.75 per share of Maxwell common stock (the ""Offer Price""). Pursuant to the Tender Offer, each share of Maxwell common stock will be exchanged for a fraction of a share of Tesla's common stock, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $4.75 by a volume weighted average price of one share of Tesla's common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market for the five consecutive trading days preceding the expiration of the Tender Offer, and which is subject to a floor that has been set at 80% of a volume weighted average price of Tesla common stock calculated prior to signing. The Tender Offer is scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on March 19, 2019.

3. On February 20, 2019, defendants filed a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (the ""Recommendation Statement"") with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""). The Recommendation Statement, which recommends that Maxwell stockholders tender their shares in favor of the Proposed Transaction, omits or misrepresents material information concerning, among other things: (i) Maxwell management's financial projections; (ii) potential conflicts of interest faced by the Company's financial advisor, Barclays Capital Inc. (""Barclays""), and Company insiders; and (iii) the data and inputs underlying the financial valuation analyses that support the fairness opinion provided by Barclays. The failure to adequately disclose such material information constitutes a violation of Sections 14(e) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act as Maxwell stockholders need such information in order to make a fully informed decision whether to tender their shares in support of the Proposed Transaction.

4. In short, the Proposed Transaction will unlawfully divest Maxwell's public stockholders of the Company's valuable assets without fully disclosing all material information concerning the Proposed Transaction to Company stockholders. To remedy defendants' Exchange Act violations, Plaintiff seeks to enjoin the expiration of the Tender Offer unless and until such problems are remedied.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. This Court has jurisdiction over the claims asserted herein for violations of Sections 14(e) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act promulgated thereunder pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 78aa, and 28 U.S.C. ยง1331 (federal question jurisdiction).

6. This Court has jurisdiction over defendants because each defendant is either a corporation that conducts business in and maintains operations in this District, or is an individual who has sufficient minimum contacts with this District so as to render the exercise of jurisdiction by this Court permissible under traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.

7. Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391 because Plaintiff's claims arose in this District, where a substantial portion of the actionable conduct took place, where most of the documents are electronically stored, and where the evidence exists. Maxwell is incorporated in Delaware and is headquartered in this District. Moreover, each of the Individual Defendants, as Company officers or directors, either resides in this District or has extensive contacts within this District.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Jonathan Mantak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al."" with case number 3:19-cv-00451. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the table under Item 12, Exhibits, specifically in the section (a)(5)(H)* as ""Class Action Complaint filed on March 7, 2019 (Jonathan Mantak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et. al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00451)"". Therefore, the Target Case is mentioned in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since the Target Case is mentioned, the next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

Since no explicit agreement was found, the next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since no agreement was found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the review of the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

Litigation Relating to the Merger

On March 6, 2019, Michael Kent, a purported stockholder of Ellie Mae, filed a putative class action complaint against Ellie Mae and our Board of Directors in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the ""Delaware District Court""), captioned Michael Kent v. Ellie Mae, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00473-UNA. The complaint filed by Michael Kent (the ""Kent Complaint"") alleges that (a) Ellie Mae and our Board of Directors violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14a-9 promulgate thereunder, by filing this Proxy Statement, which allegedly fails to disclose and/or misrepresents material information about the Merger, and (b) the members of our Board of Directors, as control persons of Ellie Mae, violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the filing of this allegedly materially deficient Proxy Statement. Michael Kent has asked the Delaware District Court to, among other things, (i) enjoin the defendants and all persons acting in concert with them from proceeding with, consummating, or closing the proposed transaction, (ii) rescind, to the extent already consummated, the proposed transaction, or grant the plaintiff recissory damages, (iii) direct the defendants to file a proxy statement that does not contain any untrue statements of material fact and states all material facts required to make the statements contained therein not misleading, (iv) declare that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder and (v) award plaintiff the costs of the action, included reasonable allowance for plaintiff's attorneys' and experts' fees.

On March 7, 2019, Shiva Stein, a purported stockholder of Ellie Mae, filed a putative class action complaint against Ellie Mae and our Board of Directors in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (the ""California District Court""), captioned Shiva Stein v. Ellie Mae, Inc. et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-01261. The complaint filed by Shiva Stein (the ""Stein Complaint"") alleges that (a) Ellie Mae and our Board of Directors violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and 17 C.F.R. ยง 244.100 promulgated thereunder, by filing this Proxy Statement, which allegedly fails to disclose and/or misrepresents material information about the Merger, (b) Ellie Mae and our Board of Directors violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, by filing this Proxy Statement, which allegedly fails to disclose and/or misrepresents material information about the Merger, and (c) the members of our Board of Directors, as control persons of Ellie Mae, violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the filing of this allegedly materially deficient Proxy Statement. Shiva Stein has asked the California District Court to, among other things, (i) enjoin the defendants and all persons acting in concert with them from proceeding with, consummating, or closing the proposed transaction, (ii) rescind, to the extent already consummated, the proposed transaction, or grant the plaintiff recissory damages, (iii) award compensatory damages against the defendants in an amount to be determined at trial and (iv) award plaintiff the costs of the action, included reasonable allowance for plaintiff's counsel and experts' fees.

On March 11, 2019, Carole Epstein, a purported stockholder of Ellie Mae, filed a putative class action complaint against Ellie Mae and our Board of Directors in the Delaware District Court, captioned Carole Epstein v. Ellie Mae, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00486-UNA. The complaint filed by Carole Epstein (the ""Epstein Complaint"") alleges that (a) Ellie Mae and our Board of Directors violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, by filing this Proxy Statement, which allegedly fails to disclose and/or misrepresents material information about the Merger and (b) the members of our Board of Directors, as control persons of Ellie Mae, violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the filing of this allegedly materially deficient Proxy Statement. Carole Epstein has asked the Delaware District Court to, among other things, (i) enjoin the defendants and all persons acting in concert with them from proceeding with, consummating, or closing the proposed transaction, (ii) rescind, to the extent already consummated, the proposed transaction, or grant the plaintiff recissory damages, (iii) direct the defendants to file a proxy statement that does not contain any untrue statements of material fact and states all material facts required to make the statements contained therein not misleading, (iv) declare that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder and (v) award plaintiff the costs of the action, included reasonable allowance for plaintiff's attorneys' and experts' fees.

Ellie Mae believes that the above described claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend both actions. Ellie Mae cannot predict the outcome of or estimate the possible loss or range of loss from either matter. It is possible that additional, similar complaints may be filed or the complaints described above will be amended. If this occurs, Ellie Mae does not intend to announce the filing of each additional, similar complaint or any amended complaint unless it contains allegations that are substantially distinct from those made in the pending actions described above.

PROPOSAL 1: ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following summary describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The descriptions of the Merger Agreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. You should carefully read and consider the entire Merger Agreement, which is the legal document that governs the Merger, because this summary may not contain all the information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.

The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement (1) were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; (2) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement; and (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by Ellie Mae, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between Ellie Mae, Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Stockholders are not third party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Ellie Mae, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Ellie Mae, Parent and Merger Sub, because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the Merger Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger Agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual information regarding Ellie Mae, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective businesses.

If this occurs, Ellie Mae does not intend to announce the filing of each additional, similar complaint or any amended complaint unless it contains allegations that are substantially distinct from those made in the pending actions described above.

PROPOSAL 1: ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following summary describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The descriptions of the Merger Agreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. You should carefully read and consider the entire Merger Agreement, which is the legal document that governs the Merger, because this summary may not contain all the information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.

The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement (1) were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; (2) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement; and (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by Ellie Mae, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between Ellie Mae, Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Stockholders are not third party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Ellie Mae, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Ellie Mae, Parent and Merger Sub, because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the Merger Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger Agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual information regarding Ellie Mae, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the Merger Agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in our filings with the SEC regarding Ellie Mae and our business.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Michael Stevens v. Ellie Mae, Inc. et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-01414"" filed in the California District Court. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the passage.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the passage mentions ""The disclosure under the heading 'The Merger - Litigation Relating to the Merger' is hereby supplemented by adding the disclosures underlined below immediately after the first paragraph and before the second paragraph on page 70 of the Definitive Proxy Statement:"" This indicates that the Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit.

However, I need to confirm that the supplemental disclosure is specifically in response to the Target Case. Upon reviewing the passage, I found that the supplemental disclosure is related to the lawsuit filed by Christopher Beveridge, but not explicitly mentioned as a response to the Target Case. Therefore, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I answered ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"", I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement or MOU related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my analysis, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",

The Company accrues for losses related to contingencies when a loss from such claims is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss from a claim is probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company reviews and evaluates its litigation and regulatory matters in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If the Company determines an unfavorable outcome is not probable or the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company does not accrue for a potential litigation loss. In those situations, the Company discloses an estimate or range of the reasonably possible losses, if such estimates can be made.

At this time, the Company does not believe that it is possible to estimate the reasonably possible losses or a range of reasonably possible losses related to the matters described below.

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.), Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.), and Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.); one action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.); and one action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. The complaints generally alleged, among other things, that the Company and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement or that the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the proxy statement violated federal securities laws, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures, as of September 30, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot.

Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-TMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0589-TMR (July 31, 2019). The Company intends to vigorously defend against these actions.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the passage.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to look for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019, in response to the complaints filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

Since there is no explicit ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"", the next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

Since there is no explicit agreement, the next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since there is no agreement found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, but there is no explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

ITEM 1. | LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the ordinary course of business, we are from time to time party to various litigation matters that we believe are incidental to the operation of our business. We record an appropriate provision when the occurrence of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We cannot estimate with certainty our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to any such pending litigation matters and it is possible one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on us. However, we believe that the outcome of such pending litigation matters will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, our consolidated financial condition or our liquidity.

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v.

- **case number**: 1:19-cv-01068-RGA

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm whether the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.)"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the ""ITEM 1. | LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"" section.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019, as stated in the following sentence: ""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019."" This supplemental disclosure is related to the merger and was made in response to the lawsuits, including the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

Since there is no explicit ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"", the next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

Since there is no explicit agreement, the next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied. I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since there is no agreement found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, but there is no explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```

    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""Yes"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019."",

In the normal course of business, the Company is party to various outstanding legal proceedings, asserted and unasserted claims, and disputes. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters, both asserted and unasserted, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

The Company accrues for losses related to contingencies when a loss from such claims is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss from a claim is probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company reviews and evaluates its litigation and regulatory matters in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If the Company determines an unfavorable outcome is not probable or the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company does not accrue for a potential litigation loss. In those situations, the Company discloses an estimate or range of the reasonably possible losses, if such estimates can be made. At this time, the Company does not believe that it is possible to estimate the reasonably possible losses or a range of reasonably possible losses related to the matters described below.

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.), Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.), and Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.); one action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.); and one action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. The complaints generally alleged, among other things, that the Company and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement or that the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the proxy statement violated federal securities laws, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures, during the six months ended December 31, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot. Plaintiffs in those actions have reserved the right to seek an award for attorneys' fees for causing the filing of the supplemental disclosures.

Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-TMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0589-TMR (July 31, 2019). Three complaints were treated as one consolidated action, and on October 8, 2019, the parties executed a Settlement and Confidentiality Agreement whereby the Company agreed to produce certain books and records to the plaintiffs in full satisfaction and dismissal of the consolidated action. The parties are meeting and conferring to resolve any outstanding questions regarding production, and plaintiffs are obligated to dismiss their cases once that process concludes.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following paragraph:

""Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger.

Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601.""

The case is indeed mentioned, so I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following paragraph:

""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019.

Plaintiffs in those actions have reserved the right to seek an award for attorneys' fees for causing the filing of the supplemental disclosures.""

The Company did issue supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuit, and the lawsuit is the Target Case. Therefore, I will answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case. Therefore, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case. However, I found that the complaints were voluntarily dismissed as moot after the Company issued supplemental disclosures. This does not necessarily imply a settlement, as the plaintiffs may have dismissed the case without an agreement.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I do not think an agreement is strongly implied in this case, as the complaints were voluntarily dismissed as moot without any explicit mention of a settlement or agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Not applicable, as I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my analysis, I will answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

ITEM 1. | LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the ordinary course of business, we are from time to time party to various litigation matters that we believe are incidental to the operation of our business. We record an appropriate provision when the occurrence of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We cannot estimate with certainty our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to any such pending litigation matters and it is possible one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on us. However, we believe that the outcome of such pending litigation matters will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, our consolidated financial condition or our liquidity.

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019 sets forth information relating to other important risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Those risk factors, in addition to the other information set forth in this report, continue to be relevant to an understanding of our business, financial condition and operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2019. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report discussed above, except as stated below.

Our business depends on the demand for our bandwidth infrastructure, driven primarily by demand for data, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. Additionally, a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our customers may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our bandwidth infrastructure or services).

Our customers' demand for our bandwidth infrastructure depends on the demand for data. The willingness of our customers to utilize our bandwidth infrastructure, or renew or extend existing contracts on our bandwidth infrastructure, is affected by numerous factors, including:

ยท | consumers' and organizations' demand for data;

ยท | availability or capacity of our bandwidth infrastructure or associated land interests;

ยท | location of our bandwidth infrastructure;

ยท | financial condition of our customers, including their profitability and availability or cost of capital;

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the section ""ITEM 1. | LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"". Therefore, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to look for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019, as stated in the following sentence: ""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019."" This supplemental disclosure was made in response to the lawsuits, including the Target Case, as indicated by the sentence: ""In light of those supplemental disclosures during the six months ended December 31, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot."" Therefore, I will answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case. However, I found that the plaintiffs in the Target Case voluntarily dismissed their complaints as moot in light of the supplemental disclosures. This does not indicate a settlement, as per the instructions.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

Since there is no explicit settlement, the next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

The Company accrues for losses related to contingencies when a loss from such claims is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss from a claim is probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company reviews and evaluates its litigation and regulatory matters in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If the Company determines an unfavorable outcome is not probable or the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company does not accrue for a potential litigation loss. In those situations, the Company discloses an estimate or range of the reasonably possible losses, if such estimates can be made.

At this time, the Company does not believe that it is possible to estimate the reasonably possible losses or a range of reasonably possible losses related to the matters described below.

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.), Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.), and Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.); one action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.); and one action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. The complaints generally alleged, among other things, that the Company and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement or that the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the proxy statement violated federal securities laws, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures, as of September 30, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot.

Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-TMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A.

Nature of the Company's Products and Offerings

Refer to the Revenue Recognition section of Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 15 - Revenue and Contract Costs in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019 for further information regarding our application of ASC 606, including practical expedients and judgments applied in determining the amounts and timing of revenue from contracts with customers.

Reconciliation of Total Revenue to Revenue from Contracts with Customers

The following table provides the amount of revenue that is not subject to ASC 606, but is instead governed by other accounting standards:

</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following paragraph:

""Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.), Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.), and Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.);""

The case is indeed mentioned, so I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to look for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following paragraph:

""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures, as of September 30, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot.""

This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuits, which includes the Target Case. Therefore, I will answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case. Therefore, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. I did not find any indication of an implied agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""Yes"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019."",

ITEM 1. | LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the ordinary course of business, we are from time to time party to various litigation matters that we believe are incidental to the operation of our business. We record an appropriate provision when the occurrence of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We cannot estimate with certainty our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to any such pending litigation matters and it is possible one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on us. However, we believe that the outcome of such pending litigation matters will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, our consolidated financial condition or our liquidity.

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.), Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.), and Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.); one action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.); and one action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. The complaints generally alleged, among other things, that the Company and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement or that the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the proxy statement violated federal securities laws, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures, as of September 30, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot.

Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del.

No. 2019-0589-TMR (July 31, 2019). The Company intends to vigorously defend against these actions.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019 sets forth information relating to other important risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019, as stated in the section ""ITEM 1. | LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"". The relevant quote is: ""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019."" This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case. Therefore, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine whether an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement, I do not need to confirm whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I can summarize the results as follows:

* The Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit.
* There is no explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

In the normal course of business, the Company is party to various outstanding legal proceedings, asserted and unasserted claims, and disputes. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters, both asserted and unasserted, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

The Company accrues for losses related to contingencies when a loss from such claims is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss from a claim is probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company reviews and evaluates its litigation and regulatory matters in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If the Company determines an unfavorable outcome is not probable or the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company does not accrue for a potential litigation loss. In those situations, the Company discloses an estimate or range of the reasonably possible losses, if such estimates can be made. At this time, the Company does not believe that it is possible to estimate the reasonably possible losses or a range of reasonably possible losses related to the matters described below.

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.), Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.), and Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.); one action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.); and one action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. The complaints generally alleged, among other things, that the Company and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement or that the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the proxy statement violated federal securities laws, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures, during the six months ended December 31, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot. Plaintiffs in those actions have reserved the right to seek an award for attorneys' fees for causing the filing of the supplemental disclosures.

Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-TMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0589-TMR (July 31, 2019). Three complaints were treated as one consolidated action, and on October 8, 2019, the parties executed a Settlement and Confidentiality Agreement whereby the Company agreed to produce certain books and records to the plaintiffs in full satisfaction and dismissal of the consolidated action. The parties are meeting and conferring to resolve any outstanding questions regarding production, and plaintiffs are obligated to dismiss their cases once that process concludes.

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following paragraph:

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

Although there is no explicit mention of an agreement, the fact that the complaints were voluntarily dismissed as moot after the Company issued supplemental disclosures implies that the parties may have reached an agreement. However, this implication is not strong enough to classify it as ""Yes (Implied Agreement)"".

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019 sets forth information relating to other important risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Those risk factors, in addition to the other information set forth in this report, continue to be relevant to an understanding of our business, financial condition and operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2019. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report discussed above, except as stated below.

Our business depends on the demand for our bandwidth infrastructure, driven primarily by demand for data, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. Additionally, a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our customers may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our bandwidth infrastructure or services).

Our customers' demand for our bandwidth infrastructure depends on the demand for data. The willingness of our customers to utilize our bandwidth infrastructure, or renew or extend existing contracts on our bandwidth infrastructure, is affected by numerous factors, including:

ยท | consumers' and organizations' demand for data;

ยท | availability or capacity of our bandwidth infrastructure or associated land interests;

ยท | location of our bandwidth infrastructure;

ยท | financial condition of our customers, including their profitability and availability or cost of capital;

Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.), Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.), and Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.); one action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.); and one action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. The complaints generally alleged, among other things, that the Company and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement or that the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the proxy statement violated federal securities laws, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures, as of September 30, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot.

Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-TMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0589-TMR (July 31, 2019). The Company intends to vigorously defend against these actions.

<target_case>
- **case number**: 1:19-cv-01112-RGA

</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the section ""ITEM 1. | LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"" as one of the complaints filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019, as stated in the section ""ITEM 1. | LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"". The supplemental disclosures were made in response to the complaints filed against the Company, including the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case, I do not need to confirm whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I conclude that the Company made supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuit, including the Target Case. However, I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

In the normal course of business, the Company is party to various outstanding legal proceedings, asserted and unasserted claims, and disputes. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters, both asserted and unasserted, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

The Company accrues for losses related to contingencies when a loss from such claims is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss from a claim is probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company reviews and evaluates its litigation and regulatory matters in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If the Company determines an unfavorable outcome is not probable or the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company does not accrue for a potential litigation loss. In those situations, the Company discloses an estimate or range of the reasonably possible losses, if such estimates can be made. At this time, the Company does not believe that it is possible to estimate the reasonably possible losses or a range of reasonably possible losses related to the matters described below.

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.), Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.), and Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.); one action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.); and one action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. The complaints generally alleged, among other things, that the Company and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement or that the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the proxy statement violated federal securities laws, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures, during the six months ended December 31, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot. Plaintiffs in those actions have reserved the right to seek an award for attorneys' fees for causing the filing of the supplemental disclosures.

Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-TMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0589-TMR (July 31, 2019). Three complaints were treated as one consolidated action, and on October 8, 2019, the parties executed a Settlement and Confidentiality Agreement whereby the Company agreed to produce certain books and records to the plaintiffs in full satisfaction and dismissal of the consolidated action. The parties are meeting and conferring to resolve any outstanding questions regarding production, and plaintiffs are obligated to dismiss their cases once that process concludes.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following paragraph:

""Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v.

This confirms that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following paragraph:

""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures, during the six months ended December 31, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot.""

This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuits, which includes the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Company made supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuits, which includes the Target Case. However, I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case.

ITEM 1. | LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the ordinary course of business, we are from time to time party to various litigation matters that we believe are incidental to the operation of our business. We record an appropriate provision when the occurrence of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We cannot estimate with certainty our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to any such pending litigation matters and it is possible one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on us. However, we believe that the outcome of such pending litigation matters will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, our consolidated financial condition or our liquidity.

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.), Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.), and Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.); one action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.); and one action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. The complaints generally alleged, among other things, that the Company and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement or that the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the proxy statement violated federal securities laws, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures during the six months ended December 31, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot. Plaintiffs in those actions have reserved the right to seek an award for attorneys' fees for causing the filing of the supplemental disclosures.

Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-TMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0589-TMR (July 31, 2019). Three complaints were treated as one consolidated action, and on October 8, 2019, the parties executed a Settlement and Confidentiality Agreement whereby the Company agreed to produce certain books and records to the plaintiffs in full satisfaction and dismissal of the consolidated action. The parties are meeting and conferring to resolve any outstanding questions regarding production, and plaintiffs are obligated to dismiss their cases once that process concludes.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019 sets forth information relating to other important risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Those risk factors, in addition to the other information set forth in this report, continue to be relevant to an understanding of our business, financial condition and operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2019. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report discussed above, except as stated below.

Our business depends on the demand for our bandwidth infrastructure, driven primarily by demand for data, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. Additionally, a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our customers may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our bandwidth infrastructure or services).

Our customers' demand for our bandwidth infrastructure depends on the demand for data. The willingness of our customers to utilize our bandwidth infrastructure, or renew or extend existing contracts on our bandwidth infrastructure, is affected by numerous factors, including:

ยท | consumers' and organizations' demand for data;

ยท | availability or capacity of our bandwidth infrastructure or associated land interests;

ยท | location of our bandwidth infrastructure;

ยท | financial condition of our customers, including their profitability and availability or cost of capital;

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the section ""ITEM 1. | LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"". Therefore, I can confirm that the Target Case is discussed in the filing.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019, in response to the complaints filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. The complaints include the Target Case. Therefore, I can confirm that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case. However, I found that the plaintiffs in the Target Case voluntarily dismissed their complaints as moot in light of the supplemental disclosures. This does not necessarily indicate a settlement.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case, I do not need to confirm whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my analysis, I can conclude that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, but there is no explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

The Company accrues for losses related to contingencies when a loss from such claims is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss from a claim is probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company reviews and evaluates its litigation and regulatory matters in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If the Company determines an unfavorable outcome is not probable or the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company does not accrue for a potential litigation loss. In those situations, the Company discloses an estimate or range of the reasonably possible losses, if such estimates can be made.

At this time, the Company does not believe that it is possible to estimate the reasonably possible losses or a range of reasonably possible losses related to the matters described below.

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger.

(13) REVENUE AND CONTRACT COSTS

Nature of the Company's Products and Offerings

Refer to the Revenue Recognition section of Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 15 - Revenue and Contract Costs in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019 for further information regarding our application of ASC 606, including practical expedients and judgments applied in determining the amounts and timing of revenue from contracts with customers.

Reconciliation of Total Revenue to Revenue from Contracts with Customers

The following table provides the amount of revenue that is not subject to ASC 606, but is instead governed by other accounting standards:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-KLM (D. Colo.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following sentence:

""One action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.).""

Although the case number in the excerpt is 1:19-cv-01747-LTB, which is different from the Target Case number 1:19-cv-01747-KLM, the case name and court are the same. I will proceed with caution and assume that the case mentioned in the excerpt is the Target Case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following sentence:

""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019.""

This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosure, but it does not explicitly state that it was in response to the lawsuit. However, the context suggests that the supplemental disclosure was made in response to the complaints filed by the plaintiffs, including the Target Case. Therefore, I will answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement, I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my analysis, I will answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

<target_case>
- **case number**: 1:19-cv-01747-KLM

- **case filing date**: 2019-06-17
- **case count**: United States District Court for the District of Colorado
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm whether the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-KLM (D. Colo.)"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the section ""ITEM 1. | LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"" as one of the actions filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. In the same section ""ITEM 1. | LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"", I found that ""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019."" This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosure, but it is not explicitly stated that it was in response to the Target Case. However, it is mentioned that ""In light of those supplemental disclosures, as of September 30, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot."" This implies that the supplemental disclosure was related to the lawsuits, including the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case, I do not need to confirm whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I conclude that the Company made supplemental disclosure, but it is not explicitly stated that it was in response to the Target Case. However, the supplemental disclosure was related to the lawsuits, including the Target Case. I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

In the normal course of business, the Company is party to various outstanding legal proceedings, asserted and unasserted claims, and disputes. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters, both asserted and unasserted, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

The Company accrues for losses related to contingencies when a loss from such claims is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss from a claim is probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company reviews and evaluates its litigation and regulatory matters in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If the Company determines an unfavorable outcome is not probable or the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company does not accrue for a potential litigation loss. In those situations, the Company discloses an estimate or range of the reasonably possible losses, if such estimates can be made. At this time, the Company does not believe that it is possible to estimate the reasonably possible losses or a range of reasonably possible losses related to the matters described below.

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.), Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.), and Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.); one action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.); and one action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. The complaints generally alleged, among other things, that the Company and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement or that the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the proxy statement violated federal securities laws, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures, during the six months ended December 31, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot. Plaintiffs in those actions have reserved the right to seek an award for attorneys' fees for causing the filing of the supplemental disclosures.

Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-TMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0589-TMR (July 31, 2019). Three complaints were treated as one consolidated action, and on October 8, 2019, the parties executed a Settlement and Confidentiality Agreement whereby the Company agreed to produce certain books and records to the plaintiffs in full satisfaction and dismissal of the consolidated action. The parties are meeting and conferring to resolve any outstanding questions regarding production, and plaintiffs are obligated to dismiss their cases once that process concludes.

Refer to the Revenue Recognition section of Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 15 - Revenue and Contract Costs in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019 for further information regarding our application of ASC 606, including practical expedients and judgments applied in determining the amounts and timing of revenue from contracts with customers.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-KLM (D. Colo.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following paragraph:

""One action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.).""

Although the case number in the excerpt is 1:19-cv-01747-LTB, which is different from the Target Case number 1:19-cv-01747-KLM, the case name and court are the same. I will proceed with caution and assume that the case mentioned in the excerpt is the Target Case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following paragraph:

""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures, during the six months ended December 31, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot.""

The excerpt explicitly mentions that the Company issued supplemental disclosures, which is in response to the lawsuits, including the Target Case. Therefore, I will answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

Since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case, I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

ITEM 1. | LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the ordinary course of business, we are from time to time party to various litigation matters that we believe are incidental to the operation of our business. We record an appropriate provision when the occurrence of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We cannot estimate with certainty our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to any such pending litigation matters and it is possible one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on us. However, we believe that the outcome of such pending litigation matters will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, our consolidated financial condition or our liquidity.

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v.

Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.); one action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.); and one action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. The complaints generally alleged, among other things, that the Company and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement or that the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the proxy statement violated federal securities laws, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures during the six months ended December 31, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot. Plaintiffs in those actions have reserved the right to seek an award for attorneys' fees for causing the filing of the supplemental disclosures.

Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-TMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0589-TMR (July 31, 2019). Three complaints were treated as one consolidated action, and on October 8, 2019, the parties executed a Settlement and Confidentiality Agreement whereby the Company agreed to produce certain books and records to the plaintiffs in full satisfaction and dismissal of the consolidated action. The parties are meeting and conferring to resolve any outstanding questions regarding production, and plaintiffs are obligated to dismiss their cases once that process concludes.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019 sets forth information relating to other important risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Those risk factors, in addition to the other information set forth in this report, continue to be relevant to an understanding of our business, financial condition and operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2019. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report discussed above, except as stated below.

Our business depends on the demand for our bandwidth infrastructure, driven primarily by demand for data, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. Additionally, a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our customers may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our bandwidth infrastructure or services).

Our customers' demand for our bandwidth infrastructure depends on the demand for data. The willingness of our customers to utilize our bandwidth infrastructure, or renew or extend existing contracts on our bandwidth infrastructure, is affected by numerous factors, including:

ยท | consumers' and organizations' demand for data;

ยท | availability or capacity of our bandwidth infrastructure or associated land interests;

ยท | location of our bandwidth infrastructure;

ยท | financial condition of our customers, including their profitability and availability or cost of capital;

<target_case>
- **case number**: 1:19-cv-01747-KLM
- **case name**: Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al.
- **case filing date**: 2019-06-17
- **case count**: United States District Court for the District of Colorado
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-KLM. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the section ""ITEM 1. | LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"" as one of the actions filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. The case is specifically mentioned as ""Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.)"". Although the case number suffix is different (KLM vs. LTB), the case name and court match the Target Case. Therefore, I will proceed with the assumption that the case discussed in the filing is the Target Case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to look for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. The filing states that ""In light of those supplemental disclosures during the six months ended December 31, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot."" This indicates that the supplemental disclosure was made in response to the lawsuits, including the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case. The filing mentions that the plaintiffs in the actions, including the Target Case, voluntarily dismissed their complaints as moot in light of the supplemental disclosures. However, this does not indicate a settlement.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

Since there is no explicit settlement, the next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

Since there is no explicit agreement, the next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied. I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since there is no agreement found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Company made supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuits, including the Target Case. However, I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

The Company accrues for losses related to contingencies when a loss from such claims is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss from a claim is probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company reviews and evaluates its litigation and regulatory matters in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If the Company determines an unfavorable outcome is not probable or the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company does not accrue for a potential litigation loss. In those situations, the Company discloses an estimate or range of the reasonably possible losses, if such estimates can be made.

At this time, the Company does not believe that it is possible to estimate the reasonably possible losses or a range of reasonably possible losses related to the matters described below.

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.), Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.), and Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.); one action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.); and one action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. The complaints generally alleged, among other things, that the Company and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement or that the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the proxy statement violated federal securities laws, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures, as of September 30, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot.

Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-TMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A.

(13) REVENUE AND CONTRACT COSTS

Nature of the Company's Products and Offerings

Refer to the Revenue Recognition section of Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 15 - Revenue and Contract Costs in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019 for further information regarding our application of ASC 606, including practical expedients and judgments applied in determining the amounts and timing of revenue from contracts with customers.

Reconciliation of Total Revenue to Revenue from Contracts with Customers

The following table provides the amount of revenue that is not subject to ASC 606, but is instead governed by other accounting standards:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following paragraph:

""Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.), Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.), and Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.);""

The case is indeed mentioned, so I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to look for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following paragraph:

""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures, as of September 30, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot.""

This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuits, including the Target Case. Therefore, I will answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case. Therefore, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. I did not find any indication of an implied agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my analysis, I will answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```
{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""Yes"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019."",

ITEM 1. | LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the ordinary course of business, we are from time to time party to various litigation matters that we believe are incidental to the operation of our business. We record an appropriate provision when the occurrence of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We cannot estimate with certainty our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to any such pending litigation matters and it is possible one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on us. However, we believe that the outcome of such pending litigation matters will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, our consolidated financial condition or our liquidity.

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.), Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.), and Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.); one action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.); and one action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. The complaints generally alleged, among other things, that the Company and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement or that the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the proxy statement violated federal securities laws, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures, as of September 30, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot.

Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del.

No. 2019-0589-TMR (July 31, 2019). The Company intends to vigorously defend against these actions.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm whether the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.)"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the section ""ITEM 1. | LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"". Therefore, I can proceed to the next step.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019, as stated in the section ""ITEM 1. | LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"". The relevant quote is: ""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019."" This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case. Therefore, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine whether an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement, I do not need to confirm whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my analysis, I found that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, but I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

In the normal course of business, the Company is party to various outstanding legal proceedings, asserted and unasserted claims, and disputes. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters, both asserted and unasserted, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

The Company accrues for losses related to contingencies when a loss from such claims is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss from a claim is probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company reviews and evaluates its litigation and regulatory matters in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If the Company determines an unfavorable outcome is not probable or the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company does not accrue for a potential litigation loss. In those situations, the Company discloses an estimate or range of the reasonably possible losses, if such estimates can be made. At this time, the Company does not believe that it is possible to estimate the reasonably possible losses or a range of reasonably possible losses related to the matters described below.

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.), Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.), and Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.); one action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.); and one action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. The complaints generally alleged, among other things, that the Company and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement or that the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the proxy statement violated federal securities laws, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures, during the six months ended December 31, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot. Plaintiffs in those actions have reserved the right to seek an award for attorneys' fees for causing the filing of the supplemental disclosures.

Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-TMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0589-TMR (July 31, 2019). Three complaints were treated as one consolidated action, and on October 8, 2019, the parties executed a Settlement and Confidentiality Agreement whereby the Company agreed to produce certain books and records to the plaintiffs in full satisfaction and dismissal of the consolidated action. The parties are meeting and conferring to resolve any outstanding questions regarding production, and plaintiffs are obligated to dismiss their cases once that process concludes.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following paragraph:

""Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v.

Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601.""

The case is indeed mentioned, so I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following paragraph:

""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures, during the six months ended December 31, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot. Plaintiffs in those actions have reserved the right to seek an award for attorneys' fees for causing the filing of the supplemental disclosures.""

The Company did issue supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuits, including the Target Case. Therefore, I will answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case. However, I found that the complaints, including the Target Case, were voluntarily dismissed as moot after the Company issued supplemental disclosures.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

Since there is no explicit ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"", I will search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

Although there is no explicit agreement, the fact that the complaints were voluntarily dismissed as moot after the Company issued supplemental disclosures implies that the parties may have reached an agreement. However, I will err on the side of caution and not classify it as an implied agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any explicit agreement, I will not confirm whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

ITEM 1. | LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the ordinary course of business, we are from time to time party to various litigation matters that we believe are incidental to the operation of our business. We record an appropriate provision when the occurrence of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We cannot estimate with certainty our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to any such pending litigation matters and it is possible one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on us. However, we believe that the outcome of such pending litigation matters will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, our consolidated financial condition or our liquidity.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019 sets forth information relating to other important risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Those risk factors, in addition to the other information set forth in this report, continue to be relevant to an understanding of our business, financial condition and operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2019. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report discussed above, except as stated below.

Our business depends on the demand for our bandwidth infrastructure, driven primarily by demand for data, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. Additionally, a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our customers may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our bandwidth infrastructure or services).

Our customers' demand for our bandwidth infrastructure depends on the demand for data. The willingness of our customers to utilize our bandwidth infrastructure, or renew or extend existing contracts on our bandwidth infrastructure, is affected by numerous factors, including:

ยท | consumers' and organizations' demand for data;

ยท | availability or capacity of our bandwidth infrastructure or associated land interests;

ยท | location of our bandwidth infrastructure;

ยท | financial condition of our customers, including their profitability and availability or cost of capital;

The Merger Agreement (Page 87 >>>> HREF[#tTMA] <<<<)

Treatment of Common Stock and Restricted Stock Units

ยท | Common Stock. At the effective time of the merger, each share of Company common stock issued and outstanding (except for the excluded shares) will convert into the right to receive the per share merger consideration of $35.00 in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes.

ยท | Restricted Stock Units. At the effective time of the merger, each award of a Company RSU shall be treated as follows, except as otherwise expressly agreed to in writing prior to the effective time of the merger by Parent and a holder of Company RSUs:

ยท | Each Company RSU that was granted prior to the date of the merger agreement and which is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the effective time (treating for this purpose any ongoing performance-based vesting condition to which any award of Company RSUs is subject as deemed to be earned based on actual performance) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to $35.00, without interest, for each share of Company common stock then subject to such Company RSU, which we refer to as the Company RSU Consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes, which cash amount will be paid as promptly as practicable following the effective time, but no later than the payment date for the first full payroll cycle following the closing date of the merger;

The restricted cash award will vest and become payable, less any applicable withholding taxes, by the surviving corporation subject to and in accordance with the time-vesting schedule and issuance or delivery schedule applicable to such Company RSU as in effect immediately prior to the effective time; and

ยท | Any Company RSU that is outstanding and vested but unsettled immediately prior to the effective time will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the Company RSU Consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes, which cash amount will be paid as promptly as practicable following the effective time, but no later than the payment date for the first full payroll cycle following the closing date of the merger.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Karels v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01809-MEH"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the Target Case is mentioned in the section ""Legal Proceedings Regarding the Merger"" on page 85. Therefore, the Target Case is discussed in the filing.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit. Therefore, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement related to the Target Case. 

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

We accrue for a loss related to contingencies when a loss from such claims is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss from a claim is probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated, we review and evaluate our litigation matters in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If we determine an unfavorable outcome is not probable or the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we do not accrue for a potential litigation loss. In those situations, we disclose an estimate or range of the reasonably possible losses, if such estimates can be made. At this time, we do not believe that it is possible to estimate the reasonably possible losses or a range of reasonably possible losses related to the matters described below.

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, the following complaints were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Zayo and its directors: on June 7, 2019, a purported Zayo stockholder filed a putative class action complaint, captioned Scarantino v.

The complaints assert claims for violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a-9 against Zayo and its directors, and claims for violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the Zayo directors. The complaint captioned Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA also asserts a claim for violations of 17 C.F.R. ยง244.100 against Zayo and its directors.

We have also received five demands from Zayo stockholders pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง220 seeking corporate books and records for, among other things, the purported purpose of investigating whether the board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. We rejected all five of these demands, which prompted three of the stockholders to file complaints against us to enforce their Section 220 rights.

As previously disclosed, on May 5, 2019, Amplify Energy Corp. (""Amplify"" or the ""Company"") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") with Midstates Petroleum Company, Inc. (""Midstates"") and Midstates Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Midstates (""Merger Sub""), pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub will merge with and into Amplify, with Amplify surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Midstates and (ii) immediately thereafter, as part of the same transaction, Amplify will merge with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of Midstates, with such subsidiary continuing as the surviving entity (collectively, the ""Merger""). On June 28, 2019, Amplify filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") a definitive proxy statement for the solicitation of proxies in connection with the special meeting of Amplify's stockholders to be held on August 2, 2019, for purposes of voting, among other things, on the adoption of the Merger Agreement (the ""Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus"").

Supplemental Disclosures in Connection with Stockholder Litigation in Connection with the Merger

In connection with the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, five purported class action complaints have been filed on behalf of Amplify stockholders against Amplify, members of the Amplify board of directors in the United States District Courts for the District of Delaware and the Southern District of New York. The five complaints are captioned as follows: Rachel Salpeter-Levy v. Amplify Energy Corp., et al, Case No.: 1:19-cv-06572 (S.D.N.Y.) (July 15, 2019), Eric Sabatini v. Amplify Energy Corp., et al, Case No.: 1:19-cv-01321 (D. Del.) (July 16, 2019), Stephen Bushansky v. Amplify Energy Corp., et al, Case No.: 1:19-cv-01339 (D. Del.) (July 17, 2019), Stephen Paul Flaherty v. Amplify Energy Corp., et al, Case No.: 1:19-cv-01333 (D. Del.) (July 17, 2019), and Barry Tresch v. Amplify Energy Corp., et al, Case No.: 1:19-cv-06740 (S.D.N.Y.) (July 19, 2019) which Amplify and Midstates refer to collectively as the ""Stockholder Actions."" In general, the Stockholder Actions allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), or aided and abetted in such alleged violations, because the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus allegedly omits or misstates material information. The Stockholder Actions seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the Merger, unspecified damages and attorneys' fees.

Amplify and the other named defendants believe that no supplemental disclosures are required under applicable laws; however, to avoid the risk of the Stockholder Actions delaying the Merger, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, Amplify is making certain disclosures below that supplement and revise those contained in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, which Amplify refers to as the ""litigation-related supplemental disclosures."" The litigation-related supplemental disclosures contained below should be read in conjunction with the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, which is available on the Internet site maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov, along with periodic reports and other information Amplify and Midstates file with the SEC. Amplify and the other named defendants have denied, and continue to deny, that they have committed or assisted others in committing any violations of law, and expressly maintain that, to the extent applicable, they complied with their legal obligations and are providing the litigation-related supplemental disclosures below solely to try to eliminate the burden and expense of further litigation, to put the claims that were or could have been asserted to rest, and to avoid any possible delay to the closing of the Merger that might arise from further litigation. Nothing in the litigation-related supplemental disclosures shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the litigation-related supplemental disclosures set forth herein. To the extent that the information set forth herein differs from or updates information contained in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the information set forth herein shall supersede or supplement the information in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. All page references are to pages in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and terms used below, unless otherwise defined, have the meanings set forth in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

The disinterested members of the Amplify board of directors unanimously recommend that Amplify stockholders vote ""FOR"" the merger agreement proposal, ""FOR"" the advisory compensation proposal and ""FOR"" the Amplify adjournment proposal.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Rachel Salpeter-Levy v. Amplify Energy Corp., et al, Case No.: 1:19-cv-06572 (S.D.N.Y.) (July 15, 2019)"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the section ""Supplemental Disclosures in Connection with Stockholder Litigation in Connection with the Merger"". Therefore, the case is discussed in the filing.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company is making certain disclosures that supplement and revise those contained in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, which Amplify refers to as the ""litigation-related supplemental disclosures"". This is in response to the Stockholder Actions, which includes the Target Case. The relevant quote is:

""Amplify and the other named defendants believe that no supplemental disclosures are required under applicable laws; however, to avoid the risk of the Stockholder Actions delaying the Merger, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, Amplify is making certain disclosures below that supplement and revise those contained in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, which Amplify refers to as the ""litigation-related supplemental disclosures"".""

Therefore, the answer to ""supplemental_disclosure"" is ""Yes"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

On June 18, 2019, another purported Zayo stockholder filed a putative class action complaint, captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601, against Zayo and its directors in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado. The complaint asserts a claim for breach of fiduciary duty against Zayo and its directors. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger due to certain deal protection provisions in the merger agreement and potential conflicts of interest, and disseminated a materially misleading proxy statement. The complaint seeks, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the merger was entered into in breach of fiduciary duty, rescission and invalidation of the merger agreement or other agreements entered into in connection with or in furtherance of the merger, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The defendants believe each of these federal cases are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against them.

We have also received five demands from Zayo stockholders pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง220 seeking corporate books and records for, among other things, the purported purpose of investigating whether the board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. We rejected all five of these demands, which prompted three of the stockholders to file complaints against us to enforce their Section 220 rights. These cases, all of which seek the books and records demanded in the respective letters are captioned as follows: Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-VCMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-VCMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A.

No. 2019-0589-VCMR (July 31, 2019). The Company intends to vigorously defend against these actions.

(15) REVENUE AND CONTRACT COSTS

Nature of the Company's Products and Offerings

The Company operates and manages the business in four reportable segments. Revenue is disaggregated by products and offerings, which the Company views as the relevant categorization of revenues for the Company's businesses. See Note 17 - Segment Reporting, for additional information on the nature of the Company's products and offerings by segment.

The Company's Fiber SPG (within the Zayo Networks segment) and zColo segments have contract terms that are accounted for as leases and are further described below.

Contracts related to the Fiber SPG are generally fixed rate contracts and can be payable upfront, on a monthly recurring basis or a combination of both. Monthly recurring payment structures in this segment generally include annual inflationary pricing escalators. A majority of the revenue earned from the Fiber line of business is not accounted for under ASC 606 as the contract terms are accounted for as lease arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue associated with its dark fiber leases on a straight-line basis from the customer acceptance date through the lease term.

The Fiber SPG may provide telecommunications construction solutions or perform variable non-routine maintenance activities that are billable to its customers. These types of solutions are accounted for under ASC 606 and are recognized as the service is performed. Revenue recognized from these non-lease arrangements was $46.5 million, $29.6 million, and $34.5 million during years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Contracts in the Company's Fiber SPG do not include significant financing components.

The Company's contract terms for the zColo segment includes terms that may be fixed or variable. The Company's zColo revenue contracts generally include multiple performance obligations including space and infrastructure, which is considered a lease component, and power and remote hand component, which are considered to be separate components of the zColo revenue arrangement. The transaction price in contracts that include multiple performance obligations is allocated to each performance obligation based on the Company's standalone selling price for each component when such offerings are sold separately. In instances where the Company does not sell the product or offering separately, the Company estimates the standalone selling prices based on observable inputs as well as various market conditions. The Company estimates the standalone selling price to be the price of the offerings when sold on a standalone basis without any promotional discounts.

The Company recognizes revenue on space and infrastructure leases on a straight-line basis over the customer lease term. The Company's customer leases often include customary renewal terms. However, the Company does not include any extension options in a customer's lease term for lease classification purposes or recognizing rental revenue unless it is reasonably certain that the customer will exercise the extension renewal option. The excess of zColo lease revenue recognized in excess of lease payments received is recorded within other assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

Customer power arrangements are coterminous with the respective customer lease and may be billed at fixed or variable rates. The Company recognizes revenue on its fixed rate power contracts as the arrangements are rendered, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the arrangements provided. Variable contracts are invoiced based on usage and are billed in arrears and recognized as the usage occurs. Revenue is recognized on remote hand services as the services are provided. Revenue recognized by the zColo segment from these non-lease arrangements was $38.5 million, $39.6 million and $36.9 million during the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively.

Contracts in the Company's zColo segment do not include significant financing components.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc."" with case number ""2019-0573"" in the Delaware Court of Chancery. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following sentence:

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement or MOU related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will proceed to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will proceed to check if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will proceed to the next step.

No. 2019-0589-TMR (July 31, 2019). The Company intends to vigorously defend against these actions.

(13) REVENUE AND CONTRACT COSTS

Nature of the Company's Products and Offerings

Refer to the Revenue Recognition section of Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 15 - Revenue and Contract Costs in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019 for further information regarding our application of ASC 606, including practical expedients and judgments applied in determining the amounts and timing of revenue from contracts with customers.

Reconciliation of Total Revenue to Revenue from Contracts with Customers

The following table provides the amount of revenue that is not subject to ASC 606, but is instead governed by other accounting standards:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Three Months Ended September 30,                                          |
|                                                 | 2019          | 2018    |
|                                                 | (in millions)           |
| Revenue from Contracts with Customers - ASC 606 | $ 346.9       | 380.9   |
| Lease Revenue - ASC 842 (1)                     | 291.7         | 260.2   |
| Total revenue                                   | $ 638.6       | $ 641.1 |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Includes revenue from use of long-term Fiber Contracts and Colocation solutions, which are not within the scope of ASC 606. See Note 14 - Leases.

Remaining Performance Obligation Associated with Non-Lease Arrangements

A majority of the Company's revenue is provided over a contract term. When allocating the total contract transaction price to identified performance obligations, a portion of the total transaction price relates to performance obligations that are yet to be satisfied or are partially satisfied as of the end of the reporting period.

Remaining performance obligations associated with the Company's contracts reflect recurring charges billed, adjusted to reflect estimates for sales incentives and revenue adjustments. At September 30, 2019, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was approximately $1.2 billion. For contracts with original durations of more than one year remaining, we expect to recognize approximately 49.3%, 31.2% and 13.2% of our remaining performance obligations as revenue during the remainder of the nine months ended June 30, 2020, year ended June 30, 2021 and year ended June 30, 2022, respectively, with the remaining balance thereafter.

However, this supplemental disclosure is not specifically associated with the Target Case.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm whether the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc."" with case number 2019-0573. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the section ""ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS"" is not relevant, but in the section describing the complaints filed against the Company, the case is mentioned as one of the complaints filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง220 seeking corporate books and records.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019, in light of the complaints filed against the Company. However, the supplemental disclosure is not specifically mentioned to be in response to the Target Case, but rather to the complaints in general.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since the supplemental disclosure is not specifically mentioned to be in response to the Target Case, I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement. I did not find any explicit mention of a settlement agreement or MOU related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my analysis, I found that the Company issued supplemental disclosures in response to the complaints filed against the Company, but it is not specifically mentioned to be in response to the Target Case. I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```

    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.), Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.), and Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.); one action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.); and one action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. The complaints generally alleged, among other things, that the Company and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement or that the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the proxy statement violated federal securities laws, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures, during the six months ended December 31, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot. Plaintiffs in those actions have reserved the right to seek an award for attorneys' fees for causing the filing of the supplemental disclosures.

Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-TMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0589-TMR (July 31, 2019). Three complaints were treated as one consolidated action, and on October 8, 2019, the parties executed a Settlement and Confidentiality Agreement whereby the Company agreed to produce certain books and records to the plaintiffs in full satisfaction and dismissal of the consolidated action. The parties are meeting and conferring to resolve any outstanding questions regarding production, and plaintiffs are obligated to dismiss their cases once that process concludes.

(13) REVENUE AND CONTRACT COSTS

Nature of the Company's Products and Offerings

Refer to the Revenue Recognition section of Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 15 - Revenue and Contract Costs in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019 for further information regarding our application of ASC 606, including practical expedients and judgments applied in determining the amounts and timing of revenue from contracts with customers.

Reconciliation of Total Revenue to Revenue from Contracts with Customers

The following table provides the amount of revenue that is not subject to ASC 606, but is instead governed by other accounting standards:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Three Months Ended December 31,                                           | Six Months Ended December 31,             |
|                                                 | 2019          | 2018    | 2019                          | 2018      |
|                                                 | (in millions)                                                       |
| Revenue from Contracts with Customers - ASC 606 | $ 341.3       | 376.2   | $ 688.2                       | $ 757.1   |
| Lease Revenue - ASC 842 (1)                     | 312.4         | 262.9   | 604.1                         | 523.1     |
| Total revenue                                   | $ 653.7       | $ 639.1 | $ 1,292.3                     | $ 1,280.2 |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Includes revenue from use of long-term Fiber Contracts and Colocation solutions, which are not within the scope of ASC 606. See Note 14 - Leases.

Remaining Performance Obligation Associated with Non-Lease Arrangements

A majority of the Company's revenue is provided over a contract term. When allocating the total contract transaction price to identified performance obligations, a portion of the total transaction price relates to performance obligations that are yet to be satisfied or are partially satisfied as of the end of the reporting period.

Remaining performance obligations associated with the Company's contracts reflect recurring charges billed, adjusted to reflect estimates for sales incentives and revenue adjustments. At December 31, 2019, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was approximately $1.2 billion. For contracts with original durations of more than one year remaining, we expect to recognize approximately 35.3%, 37.7% and 16.6% of our remaining performance obligations as revenue during the remainder of the six months ended June 30, 2020, year ended June 30, 2021 and year ended June 30, 2022, respectively, with the remaining balance thereafter.

<target_case>

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc."" with case number ""2019-0573"" in the Delaware Court of Chancery. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following sentence:

""Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-TMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0589-TMR (July 31, 2019).""

Since the Target Case is mentioned, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to look for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following sentence:

""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019.""

However, this supplemental disclosure is not specifically related to the Target Case. Instead, it is related to the complaints filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado. Therefore, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I found the following sentence:

""On October 8, 2019, the parties executed a Settlement and Confidentiality Agreement whereby the Company agreed to produce certain books and records to the plaintiffs in full satisfaction and dismissal of the consolidated action.""

This indicates that there is an explicit settlement agreement for the Target Case.

**Step 4-6: Search for Other Agreements and Confirm the Agreement Pertains the Target Case**

Since I found an explicit settlement agreement, I will not search for other agreements. The settlement agreement is case-specific, and it pertains to the Target Case, as indicated by the following sentence:

""Three complaints were treated as one consolidated action, and on October 8, 2019, the parties executed a Settlement and Confidentiality Agreement whereby the Company agreed to produce certain books and records to the plaintiffs in full satisfaction and dismissal of the consolidated action.""

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""Yes (Settlement Agreement)"" for ""reached_agreement"".

Here is the JSON object with the final answer:

```
{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""Yes (Settlement Agreement)"",

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.), Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.), and Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.); one action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.); and one action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. The complaints generally alleged, among other things, that the Company and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement or that the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the proxy statement violated federal securities laws, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures during the six months ended December 31, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot. Plaintiffs in those actions have reserved the right to seek an award for attorneys' fees for causing the filing of the supplemental disclosures.

Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-TMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0589-TMR (July 31, 2019). Three complaints were treated as one consolidated action, and on October 8, 2019, the parties executed a Settlement and Confidentiality Agreement whereby the Company agreed to produce certain books and records to the plaintiffs in full satisfaction and dismissal of the consolidated action. The parties are meeting and conferring to resolve any outstanding questions regarding production, and plaintiffs are obligated to dismiss their cases once that process concludes.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019 sets forth information relating to other important risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Those risk factors, in addition to the other information set forth in this report, continue to be relevant to an understanding of our business, financial condition and operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2019. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report discussed above, except as stated below.

Our business depends on the demand for our bandwidth infrastructure, driven primarily by demand for data, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. Additionally, a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our customers may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our bandwidth infrastructure or services).

Our customers' demand for our bandwidth infrastructure depends on the demand for data. The willingness of our customers to utilize our bandwidth infrastructure, or renew or extend existing contracts on our bandwidth infrastructure, is affected by numerous factors, including:

ยท | consumers' and organizations' demand for data;

ยท | availability or capacity of our bandwidth infrastructure or associated land interests;

ยท | location of our bandwidth infrastructure;

ยท | financial condition of our customers, including their profitability and availability or cost of capital;

ยท | willingness of our customers to maintain or increase their network investment or changes in their capital allocation strategy;

ยท | need for integrated networks and organizations;

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**
The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc."" with case number ""2019-0573"" in the Delaware Court of Chancery. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following sentence: ""Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-TMR;"". Therefore, the case is discussed in the filing.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**
The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019, in response to the complaints filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. However, this supplemental disclosure is not specifically associated with the Target Case. Therefore, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**
Since the Target Case is not associated with the supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I found that the parties executed a Settlement and Confidentiality Agreement whereby the Company agreed to produce certain books and records to the plaintiffs in full satisfaction and dismissal of the consolidated action, which includes the Target Case. Therefore, I will answer ""Yes"" for ""reached_agreement"" with the agreement type ""Settlement Agreement"".

**Step 4-6: Search for other Agreements and Handle Implied Agreement**
Since I found an explicit settlement agreement, I will stop proceeding to the next steps.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**
Based on the findings, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""Yes (Settlement Agreement)"" for ""reached_agreement"".

(13) REVENUE AND CONTRACT COSTS

Nature of the Company's Products and Offerings

Refer to the Revenue Recognition section of Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 15 - Revenue and Contract Costs in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019 for further information regarding our application of ASC 606, including practical expedients and judgments applied in determining the amounts and timing of revenue from contracts with customers.

Reconciliation of Total Revenue to Revenue from Contracts with Customers

The following table provides the amount of revenue that is not subject to ASC 606, but is instead governed by other accounting standards:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Three Months Ended September 30,                                          |
|                                                 | 2019          | 2018    |
|                                                 | (in millions)           |
| Revenue from Contracts with Customers - ASC 606 | $ 346.9       | 380.9   |
| Lease Revenue - ASC 842 (1)                     | 291.7         | 260.2   |
| Total revenue                                   | $ 638.6       | $ 641.1 |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Includes revenue from use of long-term Fiber Contracts and Colocation solutions, which are not within the scope of ASC 606. See Note 14 - Leases.

Remaining Performance Obligation Associated with Non-Lease Arrangements

A majority of the Company's revenue is provided over a contract term. When allocating the total contract transaction price to identified performance obligations, a portion of the total transaction price relates to performance obligations that are yet to be satisfied or are partially satisfied as of the end of the reporting period.

Remaining performance obligations associated with the Company's contracts reflect recurring charges billed, adjusted to reflect estimates for sales incentives and revenue adjustments. At September 30, 2019, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was approximately $1.2 billion. For contracts with original durations of more than one year remaining, we expect to recognize approximately 49.3%, 31.2% and 13.2% of our remaining performance obligations as revenue during the remainder of the nine months ended June 30, 2020, year ended June 30, 2021 and year ended June 30, 2022, respectively, with the remaining balance thereafter.

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2019-0572

- **case filing date**: 2019-07-25
- **case count**: Delaware Court of Chancery
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, Case No. 2019-0572-TMR. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following sentence:

""Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019);""

This confirms that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following sentence:

""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019.""

This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosures, but it does not explicitly state that it was in response to the lawsuit. However, the context suggests that the supplemental disclosures were made in response to the complaints filed against the Company, which includes the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""settlement agreement"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case, I do not need to confirm whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my analysis, I found that the Company made supplemental disclosures, but it is not clear if it was directly in response to the Target Case. I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2019-0572
- **case name**: Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo
- **case filing date**: 2019-07-25
- **case count**: Delaware Court of Chancery
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm whether the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo"" with case number 2019-0572. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following sentence:

""Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019);""

This confirms that the Target Case is indeed discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following sentence:

""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019.""

This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosures, but it does not explicitly state that it was in response to the lawsuit. However, the context suggests that the supplemental disclosures were made in response to the complaints filed against the Company, which includes the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement or MOU related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Company made supplemental disclosures, but it is not clear if it was directly in response to the Target Case. I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.), Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.), and Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.); one action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.); and one action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. The complaints generally alleged, among other things, that the Company and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement or that the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the proxy statement violated federal securities laws, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures during the six months ended December 31, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot. Plaintiffs in those actions have reserved the right to seek an award for attorneys' fees for causing the filing of the supplemental disclosures.

Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-TMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0589-TMR (July 31, 2019). Three complaints were treated as one consolidated action, and on October 8, 2019, the parties executed a Settlement and Confidentiality Agreement whereby the Company agreed to produce certain books and records to the plaintiffs in full satisfaction and dismissal of the consolidated action. The parties are meeting and conferring to resolve any outstanding questions regarding production, and plaintiffs are obligated to dismiss their cases once that process concludes.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019 sets forth information relating to other important risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Those risk factors, in addition to the other information set forth in this report, continue to be relevant to an understanding of our business, financial condition and operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2019. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report discussed above, except as stated below.

Our business depends on the demand for our bandwidth infrastructure, driven primarily by demand for data, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. Additionally, a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our customers may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our bandwidth infrastructure or services).

Our customers' demand for our bandwidth infrastructure depends on the demand for data. The willingness of our customers to utilize our bandwidth infrastructure, or renew or extend existing contracts on our bandwidth infrastructure, is affected by numerous factors, including:

ยท | consumers' and organizations' demand for data;

ยท | availability or capacity of our bandwidth infrastructure or associated land interests;

ยท | location of our bandwidth infrastructure;

ยท | financial condition of our customers, including their profitability and availability or cost of capital;

ยท | willingness of our customers to maintain or increase their network investment or changes in their capital allocation strategy;

ยท | need for integrated networks and organizations;

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, Case No. 2019-0572-TMR. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following sentence:

""Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019);""

This confirms that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to look for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following sentence:

""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019.""

This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosures, but it does not explicitly state that it was in response to the lawsuit. However, the sentence that follows suggests a connection:

""In light of those supplemental disclosures during the six months ended December 31, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot.""

This implies that the supplemental disclosures were made in response to the complaints, which includes the Target Case. Therefore, I conclude that the Company made supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I found the following sentence:

""On October 8, 2019, the parties executed a Settlement and Confidentiality Agreement whereby the Company agreed to produce certain books and records to the plaintiffs in full satisfaction and dismissal of the consolidated action.""

This explicitly mentions a ""Settlement and Confidentiality Agreement"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4-6: Search for Other Agreements and Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**

Since I found an explicit settlement agreement, I do not need to search for other agreements. The settlement agreement is case-specific, and the context confirms that it pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I conclude that:

* The Company made supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuit.
* The Company reached a settlement agreement with the parties of the Target Case.

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2019-0589
- **case name**: Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc.
- **case filing date**: 2019-07-31
- **case count**: Delaware Court of Chancery
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., Case No. 2019-0589-TMR. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following sentence:

""Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-TMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0589-TMR (July 31, 2019).""

Since the Target Case is mentioned, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following sentence:

""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019.""

However, this sentence does not explicitly state that the supplemental disclosure is in response to the lawsuit. But the following sentence provides more context:

""In light of those supplemental disclosures, as of September 30, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot.""

This suggests that the supplemental disclosure is related to the complaints, which include the Target Case. Therefore, I will answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement, I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my analysis, I will answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```
{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""Yes"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019."",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""note"": ""Case not mentioned in the context of an agreement.""
}
```",Yes,"The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019.",No,Not applicable,No,FALSE,supplemental_disclosure flag is incorrect.

Item 8.01 | Other Events.

On October 30, 2018, a putative derivative and class action complaint was filed against the members of the board of directors of Forest City Realty Trust, Inc. (""Forest City"" or the ""Company"") on behalf of the Company and the stockholders of the Company in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City under the caption Scarantino v. Bacon et al., Case No. 24-c-18-005838 (Md. Cir. Ct., Baltimore City) (the ""Action""). The complaint alleges that the members of the board of directors of Forest City (""defendants"") breached fiduciary duties owed to Forest City stockholders because they, among other things, made inadequate disclosures in a definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on October 12, 2018 (the ""Proxy Statement"") regarding the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 30, 2018 (the ""Merger Agreement""), by and among Forest City, Antlia Holdings LLC (""Parent"") and Antlia Merger Sub Inc. (""Merger Sub""), pursuant to which the parties agreed that, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Forest City, with Forest City surviving such merger and becoming a subsidiary of Parent (the ""Merger""). The complaint filed in the Action alleges that the Proxy Statement omits material information, rendering the information disclosed misleading. The Action seeks, among other things, orders (i) enjoining the defendants from proceeding with or consummating the Merger, (ii) directing the defendants to account for all damages sustained by the putative class, and (iii) awarding plaintiff's costs and attorneys' and expert fees.

While the Company believes that the Action is without merit and that the disclosures in the Proxy Statement comply fully with applicable law, in order to avoid the expense and distraction of litigation, on November 2, 2018, the parties to the Action entered into an agreement in principle to settle and release all claims that were or could have been alleged by the plaintiff in his individual capacity in the Action. The settlement provides for the dismissal with prejudice of the plaintiff's individual claims and dismissal without prejudice of the claims asserted derivatively on behalf of Forest City and those asserted on behalf of a purported class, subject to, among other things, the Company's supplementation of the Proxy Statement with the amended and supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Amended and Supplemental Disclosures"").

The Amended and Supplemental Disclosures should be read in conjunction with the Proxy Statement, which should be read in its entirety. Defined terms used but not defined in the Amended and Supplemental Disclosures have the meanings set forth in the Proxy Statement. The plaintiff has agreed that, following the filing of this Current Report on Form 8-K (this ""Report""), he will dismiss the Action in its entirety, with prejudice as to the named plaintiff's individual claims only and without prejudice as to the claims asserted derivatively on behalf of Forest City and those asserted on behalf of a purported class.

The resolution of the Action will not affect the timing of the special meeting of Forest City stockholders, which is scheduled to be held on November 15, 2018, or the amount of the consideration to be paid to Forest City stockholders in connection with the Merger. The resolution of the Action is not, and should not be construed as, an admission of wrongdoing or liability by any defendant. Furthermore, nothing in this Report or the resolution of the Action shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality of any of the disclosures set forth in this Report. Likewise, the Company does not believe that any further disclosure regarding the Merger is required under applicable laws other than that which has already been provided in the Proxy Statement. However, to avoid the risk of the putative shareholder class Action delaying or adversely affecting the Merger, to minimize the substantial expense, burden, distraction and inconvenience of continued litigation and to resolve the plaintiff's claims asserted in the Action, the Company has agreed to make these Amended and Supplemental Disclosures to the Proxy Statement.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there is a discussion around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Scarantino v. Bacon et al., Case No. 24-c-18-005838 (Md. Cir. Ct., Baltimore City)"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the passage.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company has agreed to make supplemental disclosures to the Proxy Statement as part of the settlement agreement. The relevant quote is:

""The settlement provides for the dismissal with prejudice of the plaintiff's individual claims and dismissal without prejudice of the claims asserted derivatively on behalf of Forest City and those asserted on behalf of a purported class, subject to, among other things, the Company's supplementation of the Proxy Statement with the amended and supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Amended and Supplemental Disclosures"").""

This indicates that the Company has agreed to make supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I found that the parties to the Action entered into an agreement in principle to settle and release all claims that were or could have been alleged by the plaintiff in his individual capacity in the Action. The relevant quote is:

""While the Company believes that the Action is without merit and that the disclosures in the Proxy Statement comply fully with applicable law, in order to avoid the expense and distraction of litigation, on November 2, 2018, the parties to the Action entered into an agreement in principle to settle and release all claims that were or could have been alleged by the plaintiff in his individual capacity in the Action.""

This indicates that there is an explicit settlement agreement for the Target Case.

**Step 4-6: Search for Other Agreements and Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**

Since we have already found an explicit settlement agreement, we can skip steps 4 and 5. In step 6, we need to confirm that the agreement pertains to the Target Case. The agreement is case-specific, and the context around the agreement discussion confirms that it pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the findings, we can summarize the results as follows:

* The Company has agreed to make supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuit.
* There is an explicit settlement agreement for the Target Case.

Item 8.01 | Other Events.

On October 30, 2018, a putative derivative and class action complaint was filed against the members of the board of directors of Forest City Realty Trust, Inc. (""Forest City"" or the ""Company"") on behalf of the Company and the stockholders of the Company in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City under the caption Scarantino v. Bacon et al., Case No. 24-c-18-005838 (Md. Cir. Ct., Baltimore City) (the ""Action""). The complaint alleges that the members of the board of directors of Forest City (""defendants"") breached fiduciary duties owed to Forest City stockholders because they, among other things, made inadequate disclosures in a definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on October 12, 2018 (the ""Proxy Statement"") regarding the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 30, 2018 (the ""Merger Agreement""), by and among Forest City, Antlia Holdings LLC (""Parent"") and Antlia Merger Sub Inc. (""Merger Sub""), pursuant to which the parties agreed that, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Forest City, with Forest City surviving such merger and becoming a subsidiary of Parent (the ""Merger""). The complaint filed in the Action alleges that the Proxy Statement omits material information, rendering the information disclosed misleading. The Action seeks, among other things, orders (i) enjoining the defendants from proceeding with or consummating the Merger, (ii) directing the defendants to account for all damages sustained by the putative class, and (iii) awarding plaintiff's costs and attorneys' and expert fees.

While the Company believes that the Action is without merit and that the disclosures in the Proxy Statement comply fully with applicable law, in order to avoid the expense and distraction of litigation, on November 2, 2018, the parties to the Action entered into an agreement in principle to settle and release all claims that were or could have been alleged by the plaintiff in his individual capacity in the Action. The settlement provides for the dismissal with prejudice of the plaintiff's individual claims and dismissal without prejudice of the claims asserted derivatively on behalf of Forest City and those asserted on behalf of a purported class, subject to, among other things, the Company's supplementation of the Proxy Statement with the amended and supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Amended and Supplemental Disclosures"").

The Amended and Supplemental Disclosures should be read in conjunction with the Proxy Statement, which should be read in its entirety. Defined terms used but not defined in the Amended and Supplemental Disclosures have the meanings set forth in the Proxy Statement. The plaintiff has agreed that, following the filing of this Current Report on Form 8-K (this ""Report""), he will dismiss the Action in its entirety, with prejudice as to the named plaintiff's individual claims only and without prejudice as to the claims asserted derivatively on behalf of Forest City and those asserted on behalf of a purported class.

The resolution of the Action will not affect the timing of the special meeting of Forest City stockholders, which is scheduled to be held on November 15, 2018, or the amount of the consideration to be paid to Forest City stockholders in connection with the Merger. The resolution of the Action is not, and should not be construed as, an admission of wrongdoing or liability by any defendant. Furthermore, nothing in this Report or the resolution of the Action shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality of any of the disclosures set forth in this Report. Likewise, the Company does not believe that any further disclosure regarding the Merger is required under applicable laws other than that which has already been provided in the Proxy Statement. However, to avoid the risk of the putative shareholder class Action delaying or adversely affecting the Merger, to minimize the substantial expense, burden, distraction and inconvenience of continued litigation and to resolve the plaintiff's claims asserted in the Action, the Company has agreed to make these Amended and Supplemental Disclosures to the Proxy Statement.

The first step is to confirm that there is a discussion around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Scarantino v. Bacon et al., Case No. 24-c-18-005838 (Md. Cir. Ct., Baltimore City)"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the passage.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company has agreed to make supplemental disclosures to the Proxy Statement as part of the settlement agreement. The relevant quote is:

""The settlement provides for the dismissal with prejudice of the plaintiff's individual claims and dismissal without prejudice of the claims asserted derivatively on behalf of Forest City and those asserted on behalf of a purported class, subject to, among other things, the Company's supplementation of the Proxy Statement with the amended and supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Amended and Supplemental Disclosures"").""

This indicates that the Company has agreed to make supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I found that the parties to the Action entered into an agreement in principle to settle and release all claims that were or could have been alleged by the plaintiff in his individual capacity in the Action.

As previously disclosed in the Company's Form 8-K and Schedule 14A filed on January 29, 2019, after the Proxy Statement was filed, the following putative class actions were commenced by purported stockholders of the Company:

(i) in the United States District Court of Delaware, captioned Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00138-UNA (the ""Sabatini Complaint"");

(ii) in California Superior Court of San Luis Obispo County, captioned Schmit v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al., Case No. 19CV-0043 (the ""Schmit Complaint""), which was subsequently dismissed voluntarily without prejudice on February 1, 2019;

(iii) in the United States District Court of Central District of California, captioned Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al., Case No. 2:19-cv-00638 (the ""Tran Complaint""); and

(iv) in the Court of Chancery of Delaware, captioned Ryan v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019-0061 (the ""Ryan Complaint"").

The Ryan Complaint alleges, among other things, that the irrevocable proxies granted by Richard Stollmeyer, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company Board, certain parties related to Richard Stollmeyer, and Institutional Venture Partners XIII, L.P. (the ""Signing Stockholders"") caused a transfer of voting control of the Signing Stockholders' Class B common stock, which in turn caused the Signing Stockholders' shares of Class B common stock to be automatically converted into shares of Class A common stock entitled to one vote for each such share of Class A common stock, as opposed to ten votes for each share of Class B common stock. If, as alleged in the Ryan Complaint, the Class B common stock held by the Signing Stockholders were converted into shares of Class A common stock, then, as of the Record Date: (i) there would have been 47,763,583 shares of Class A common stock and 252,950 shares of Class B common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, (ii) 25,146,542 votes would constitute a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY common stock required to adopt the Merger Agreement and the holders of such majority of the voting power would constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting, (iii) the Signing Stockholders would have held, in the aggregate, approximately 6.33% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY's common stock (and approximately 8.43% when taking into account MINDBODY options and RSUs held, in the aggregate, by the Signing Stockholders), and (iv) our directors and executive officers would have held, in the aggregate, approximately 1.33% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY's common stock (and approximately 9.33% when taking into account MINDBODY options and RSUs held, in the aggregate, by our directors and executive officers). The Company vigorously disputes the allegations in the Ryan Complaint and the claim that the Signing Stockholders' shares of Class B common stock were converted into Class A common stock, and believes that the numbers and percentages as of the Record Date are as set forth in the Proxy Statement. However, even if the Class B common stock were converted into Class A common stock as alleged in the Ryan Complaint, the Board of Directors nonetheless encourages stockholders to vote ""FOR"" the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the other proposals set forth in the Proxy Statement.

As previously disclosed in the Company's Schedule 14A, also filed on January 29, 2019, counsel for Luxor Capital Partners, LP, Luxor Wavefront, LP, Lugard Road Capital Master Fund, LP, Luxor Capital Partners Offshore Master Fund, LP, Luxor Capital Partners Offshore, Ltd., Luxor Capital Group, LP, LCG Holdings, LLC, Lugard Road Capital GP, LLC and Luxor Management, LLC (together, ""Luxor"") sent a demand letter (""the Luxor Demand Letter"") to MINDBODY pursuant to Section 220(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (""DGCL"").

After the Company's January 29th filings, on January 30, 2019, Luxor filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of Delaware, captioned Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc., Case No. 2019-0070 (the ""Luxor Complaint""), included below, on January 31, 2019, Hyan Tang, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a putative class action suit in the United States District Court of Delaware, captioned Tang v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00210-UNA (the ""Tang Complaint""), included below; and on February 4, 2019, Sunil Kumar, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a putative class action suit in the United States District Court of the Central District of California, captioned Kumar v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. (the ""Kumar Complaint,"" included below, and together with the Sabatini Complaint, the Schmit Complaint, the Tran Complaint, the Ryan Complaint, the Luxor Complaint and the Tang Complaint, the ""Complaints"").

The following documents in connection with the Luxor Complaint are also included below: Luxor's Motion to Expedite, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on January 30, 2019, Luxor's Statement of Good Cause, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on January 30, 2019, MINDBODY's Opposition to Luxor's Motion to Expedite, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on February 1, 2019, Luxor's Reply to MINDBODY's Opposition, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on February 4, 2019, and the Order of the Court of Chancery of Delaware, granted on February 4, 2019.

The Company believes the Complaints are without merit, and the Company has vigorously defended and continues to vigorously defend against the Complaints.

While the Company believes that the disclosures set forth in the Proxy Statement comply fully with applicable law, in order to moot plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Complaints, avoid nuisance and possible expense, and provide additional information to the Company's stockholders, the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Supplemental Disclosures""). Nothing in the Supplemental Disclosures shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the Complaints that any additional disclosure was or is required.

Since the supplemental disclosure is not explicitly associated with the Target Case, I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a settlement agreement or MOU related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any implied agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" because the supplemental disclosure is not explicitly associated with the Target Case. I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"" because I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case.

The Ryan Complaint alleges, among other things, that the irrevocable proxies granted by Richard Stollmeyer, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company Board, certain parties related to Richard Stollmeyer, and Institutional Venture Partners XIII, L.P. (the ""Signing Stockholders"") caused a transfer of voting control of the Signing Stockholders' Class B common stock, which in turn caused the Signing Stockholders' shares of Class B common stock to be automatically converted into shares of Class A common stock entitled to one vote for each such share of Class A common stock, as opposed to ten votes for each share of Class B common stock. If, as alleged in the Ryan Complaint, the Class B common stock held by the Signing Stockholders were converted into shares of Class A common stock, then, as of the Record Date: (i) there would have been 47,763,583 shares of Class A common stock and 252,950 shares of Class B common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, (ii) 25,146,542 votes would constitute a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY common stock required to adopt the Merger Agreement and the holders of such majority of the voting power would constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting, (iii) the Signing Stockholders would have held, in the aggregate, approximately 6.33% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY's common stock (and approximately 8.43% when taking into account MINDBODY options and RSUs held, in the aggregate, by the Signing Stockholders), and (iv) our directors and executive officers would have held, in the aggregate, approximately 1.33% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY's common stock (and approximately 9.33% when taking into account MINDBODY options and RSUs held, in the aggregate, by our directors and executive officers). The Company vigorously disputes the allegations in the Ryan Complaint and the claim that the Signing Stockholders' shares of Class B common stock were converted into Class A common stock, and believes that the numbers and percentages as of the Record Date are as set forth in the Proxy Statement. However, even if the Class B common stock were converted into Class A common stock as alleged in the Ryan Complaint, the Board of Directors nonetheless encourages stockholders to vote ""FOR"" the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the other proposals set forth in the Proxy Statement.

As previously disclosed in the Company's Schedule 14A, also filed on January 29, 2019, counsel for Luxor Capital Partners, LP, Luxor Wavefront, LP, Lugard Road Capital Master Fund, LP, Luxor Capital Partners Offshore Master Fund, LP, Luxor Capital Partners Offshore, Ltd., Luxor Capital Group, LP, LCG Holdings, LLC, Lugard Road Capital GP, LLC and Luxor Management, LLC (together, ""Luxor"") sent a demand letter (""the Luxor Demand Letter"") to MINDBODY pursuant to Section 220(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (""DGCL"").

After the Company's January 29th filings, on January 30, 2019, Luxor filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of Delaware, captioned Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc., Case No. 2019-0070 (the ""Luxor Complaint""), included below, on January 31, 2019, Hyan Tang, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a putative class action suit in the United States District Court of Delaware, captioned Tang v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00210-UNA (the ""Tang Complaint""), included below; and on February 4, 2019, Sunil Kumar, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a putative class action suit in the United States District Court of the Central District of California, captioned Kumar v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. (the ""Kumar Complaint,"" included below, and together with the Sabatini Complaint, the Schmit Complaint, the Tran Complaint, the Ryan Complaint, the Luxor Complaint and the Tang Complaint, the ""Complaints"").

The following documents in connection with the Luxor Complaint are also included below: Luxor's Motion to Expedite, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on January 30, 2019, Luxor's Statement of Good Cause, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on January 30, 2019, MINDBODY's Opposition to Luxor's Motion to Expedite, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on February 1, 2019, Luxor's Reply to MINDBODY's Opposition, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on February 4, 2019, and the Order of the Court of Chancery of Delaware, granted on February 4, 2019.

The Company believes the Complaints are without merit, and the Company has vigorously defended and continues to vigorously defend against the Complaints.

While the Company believes that the disclosures set forth in the Proxy Statement comply fully with applicable law, in order to moot plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Complaints, avoid nuisance and possible expense, and provide additional information to the Company's stockholders, the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Supplemental Disclosures""). Nothing in the Supplemental Disclosures shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the Complaints that any additional disclosure was or is required.

Supplemental Disclosures to Proxy Statement

The following supplemental information should be read in conjunction with the Proxy Statement, which should be read in its entirety. All page references are to pages in the Proxy Statement, and terms used below, unless otherwise defined, have the meanings set forth in the Proxy Statement. Underlined text shows text being added to a referenced disclosure in the Proxy Statement and a line through text shows text being deleted from a referenced disclosure in the Proxy Statement.

The disclosure under the heading ""The Merger--Background of the Merger"" is hereby supplemented by adding the underlined disclosure after the first paragraph under that heading on page 26 of the Proxy Statement:

In the first half of August 2018, as part of Qatalyst Partners' customary coverage of software companies, a representative of Qatalyst Partners had a meeting with Mr. Stollmeyer. Following this meeting, Qatalyst Partners reached out to Vista, Party A, and Party B as typical outreach to connect strategic companies, including MINDBODY, to such parties.

Separately, on August 7, 2018, a representative of Vista emailed Mr. Stollmeyer, offering to meet for lunch, which took place on September 4, 2018, and at which Mr. Stollmeyer provided the representative of Vista with a general overview of MINDBODY and its approach to the fitness, beauty and wellness services industries as was typical for Mr. Stollmeyer to present to potential investors.

On September 19, 2018, Mr. Stollmeyer received an invitation from the representative of Vista to attend an annual ""meet and greet"" conference hosted by Vista bringing together hundreds of executives in the technology sector, including from Vista's portfolio companies.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm whether the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is Schmit v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 19CV-0043, filed on January 24, 2019, in the California Superior Court of San Luis Obispo County. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Target Case.

As previously disclosed, on April 9, 2018, the Company entered into the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 9, 2018 (the ""Merger Agreement""), among the Company, Vertex Holdco LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (""Parent""), and Vertex Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (""Merger Sub""). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the ""Merger""), with the Company continuing as the surviving company in the Merger. Parent and Merger Sub are owned by an investor group led by the private equity investment firm Francisco Partners. On May 21, 2018, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") the Definitive Proxy Statement with respect to the special meeting of the Company's stockholders scheduled to be held on June 19, 2018, in connection with the Merger (the ""Special Meeting"").

Litigation Related to the Merger

As previously disclosed, in connection with the Merger, two putative class action lawsuits, Scarantino v. VeriFone Systems, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-00752-VAC-CJB, and Byrne v. VeriFone Systems, Inc., et al., Case No. 4:18-cv-02926-YGR, were filed on May 17, 2018, against the Company and its directors in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, respectively. On May 30, 2018, a third lawsuit, Raul v. VeriFone Systems, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:18-cv-03215-JSW, was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and on June 1, 2018, a fourth lawsuit, Lowinger v. VeriFone Systems, Inc. et al. Case No. 1:18-cv-00829-UNA was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.

The complaints generally allege that the preliminary proxy statement filed by the Company with the SEC on May 7, 2018, in connection with the Merger misrepresents and/or omits certain purportedly material information. The allegations relate to the Company's financial projections, the valuation analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners, the background of the Merger, and any potential conflicts of interest of the Company's management or directors with respect to the Merger. The complaints allege that such misrepresentations and/or omissions render the proxy statement false and misleading and accordingly allege violations of Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act""), as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The complaints seek, among other things, an injunction against the consummation of the Merger, costs of the action, including plaintiffs' attorneys' and experts' fees, declaratory relief, and any other relief the courts may deem just and proper. On May 25, 2018, the plaintiff in the Byrne action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the holding of the Special Meeting until certain additional information is disclosed in the Company's Definitive Proxy Statement.

While the Company believes that the actions lack merit and that the disclosures in the Definitive Proxy Statement comply fully with applicable law, in order to avoid the expense and distraction of litigation and following discussions with counsel for plaintiffs in the Scarantino and Byrne actions, the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Supplemental Disclosures"").

Nothing in the Supplemental Disclosures shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable law of the Supplemental Disclosures. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations that any of the Supplemental Disclosures, or any other additional disclosures, were or are required.

SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES TO DEFINITIVE PROXY STATEMENT

These Supplemental Disclosures should be read in conjunction with the Definitive Proxy Statement, which should be read in its entirety. All page references in the information below are to pages in the Definitive Proxy Statement, and all capitalized terms used below shall have the meanings set forth in the Definitive Proxy Statement. Paragraph references used herein refer to the proxy statement before any additions or deletions resulting from the supplemental disclosures. Underlined text shows text being added to a referenced disclosure in the Definitive Proxy Statement. The information contained herein speaks only as of June 6, 2018 unless the information indicates that another date applies.

The Section of the Proxy Statement titled ""The Merger--Background of the Merger"" is hereby supplemented by amending the paragraph on Page 32 that begins ""On February 26, 2018 . . ."" as follows to add the underlined sentence:

On February 26, 2018, the Company and Party 1 amended their previously existing non-disclosure agreement, dated as of July 16, 2016, to extend the term thereof in connection with Party 1's interest in evaluating a potential transaction between the parties and to require the Company's prior written consent before approaching any potential co-investor or other provider of debt or equity financing. The non-disclosure agreement, as amended, with Party 1 did not contain any standstill restrictions.

The Section of the Proxy Statement titled ""The Merger--Background of the Merger"" is hereby supplemented by amending the paragraph on Page 32 that begins ""On March 1, 2018, the Company and Party 2 . . ."" as follows to add the underlined sentence:

On March 1, 2018, the Company and Party 2 entered into a customary non-disclosure agreement in connection with the evaluation of a potential transaction between the parties. The non-disclosure agreement with Party 2 did not contain any standstill restrictions. Party 1 and Party 2 determined that they would work together to evaluate whether to make a joint proposal to acquire the Company. We refer to Party 1 and Party 2 together as the Joint Bidder Group. That same day, the Company provided access to an electronic dataroom to Joint Bidder Group to facilitate their due diligence review.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Scarantino v. VeriFone Systems, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-00752-VAC-CJB. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the section ""Litigation Related to the Merger"". Therefore, I can proceed to the next step.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Supplemental Disclosures"") in order to avoid the expense and distraction of litigation and following discussions with counsel for plaintiffs in the Scarantino and Byrne actions. This indicates that the Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement, I do not need to confirm whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I can summarize the results as follows:

* The Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit.
* There is no explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

The complaints seek, among other things, an injunction against the consummation of the Merger, costs of the action, including plaintiffs' attorneys' and experts' fees, declaratory relief, and any other relief the courts may deem just and proper. On May 25, 2018, the plaintiff in the Byrne action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the holding of the Special Meeting until certain additional information is disclosed in the Company's Definitive Proxy Statement.

While the Company believes that the actions lack merit and that the disclosures in the Definitive Proxy Statement comply fully with applicable law, in order to avoid the expense and distraction of litigation and following discussions with counsel for plaintiffs in the Scarantino and Byrne actions, the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Supplemental Disclosures"").

Nothing in the Supplemental Disclosures shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable law of the Supplemental Disclosures. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations that any of the Supplemental Disclosures, or any other additional disclosures, were or are required.

The Company's Board of Directors continues to unanimously recommend that you vote ""FOR"" the adoption of the Merger Agreement and ""FOR"" the other proposals being considered at the Special Meeting.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Byrne v. VeriFone Systems, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:18-cv-02926. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the section ""Litigation Related to the Merger"". Therefore, the Target Case is discussed in the filing.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Supplemental Disclosures"") following discussions with counsel for plaintiffs in the Scarantino and Byrne actions. The Supplemental Disclosures are specifically in response to the lawsuits, including the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since no agreement was found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, the Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, including the Target Case. However, there is no explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

As previously disclosed, in connection with the Merger, two putative class action lawsuits, Scarantino v. VeriFone Systems, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-00752-VAC-CJB, and Byrne v. VeriFone Systems, Inc., et al., Case No. 4:18-cv-02926-YGR, were filed on May 17, 2018, against the Company and its directors in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, respectively.

VeriFone Systems, Inc. et al. Case No. 1:18-cv-00829-UNA was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.

The complaints generally allege that the preliminary proxy statement filed by the Company with the SEC on May 7, 2018, in connection with the Merger misrepresents and/or omits certain purportedly material information. The allegations relate to the Company's financial projections, the valuation analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners, the background of the Merger, and any potential conflicts of interest of the Company's management or directors with respect to the Merger.

The information contained herein speaks only as of June 6, 2018 unless the information indicates that another date applies.

The Section of the Proxy Statement titled ""The Merger--Background of the Merger"" is hereby supplemented by amending the paragraph on Page 32 that begins ""On February 26, 2018 . . ."" as follows to add the underlined sentence:

On February 26, 2018, the Company and Party 1 amended their previously existing non-disclosure agreement, dated as of July 16, 2016, to extend the term thereof in connection with Party 1's interest in evaluating a potential transaction between the parties and to require the Company's prior written consent before approaching any potential co-investor or other provider of debt or equity financing.

None of the non-disclosure agreements contained any standstill restrictions. On May 4, 2018, representatives of management met with representatives of Party 3 to discuss the Company's business and related due diligence matters and on May 10, 2018, representatives of management held a telephone conference call with representatives of Party 4 to discuss the Company's business and related due diligence matters.

- **case count**: United States District Court for the Northern District of California
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Byrne v. VeriFone Systems, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:18-cv-02926. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following sentence:

""On May 30, 2018, a third lawsuit, Raul v. VeriFone Systems, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:18-cv-03215-JSW, was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and on June 1, 2018, a fourth lawsuit, Lowinger v. VeriFone Systems, Inc. et al. Case No. 1:18-cv-00829-UNA was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.""

However, the correct case number for the Target Case is 3:18-cv-02926, not 3:18-cv-03215-JSW. But the Target Case is actually mentioned in the following sentence:

""As previously disclosed, in connection with the Merger, two putative class action lawsuits, Scarantino v. VeriFone Systems, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-00752-VAC-CJB, and Byrne v. VeriFone Systems, Inc., et al., Case No. 4:18-cv-02926-YGR, were filed on May 17, 2018, against the Company and its directors in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, respectively.""

The case number is mentioned as 4:18-cv-02926-YGR, which seems to be incorrect. However, the case name and the court match the Target Case. Therefore, I will proceed with the assumption that the Target Case is indeed discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following sentence:

""While the Company believes that the actions lack merit and that the disclosures in the Definitive Proxy Statement comply fully with applicable law, in order to avoid the expense and distraction of litigation and following discussions with counsel for plaintiffs in the Scarantino and Byrne actions, the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Supplemental Disclosures"").""

This sentence indicates that the Company has agreed to make supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit. The lawsuit mentioned is the Byrne action, which is the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement or an MOU related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Company has agreed to make supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, which is the Target Case. However, I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case.

Litigation Related to the Merger

VeriFone Systems, Inc. et al. Case No. 1:18-cv-00829-UNA was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.

The complaints generally allege that the preliminary proxy statement filed by the Company with the SEC on May 7, 2018, in connection with the Merger misrepresents and/or omits certain purportedly material information. The allegations relate to the Company's financial projections, the valuation analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners, the background of the Merger, and any potential conflicts of interest of the Company's management or directors with respect to the Merger. The complaints allege that such misrepresentations and/or omissions render the proxy statement false and misleading and accordingly allege violations of Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act""), as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The complaints seek, among other things, an injunction against the consummation of the Merger, costs of the action, including plaintiffs' attorneys' and experts' fees, declaratory relief, and any other relief the courts may deem just and proper. On May 25, 2018, the plaintiff in the Byrne action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the holding of the Special Meeting until certain additional information is disclosed in the Company's Definitive Proxy Statement.

The Section of the Proxy Statement titled ""The Merger--Background of the Merger"" is hereby supplemented by amending the paragraph on Page 32 that begins ""On March 1, 2018, the Company and Party 2 . . ."" as follows to add the underlined sentence:

On March 1, 2018, the Company and Party 2 entered into a customary non-disclosure agreement in connection with the evaluation of a potential transaction between the parties. The non-disclosure agreement with Party 2 did not contain any standstill restrictions. Party 1 and Party 2 determined that they would work together to evaluate whether to make a joint proposal to acquire the Company. We refer to Party 1 and Party 2 together as the Joint Bidder Group. That same day, the Company provided access to an electronic dataroom to Joint Bidder Group to facilitate their due diligence review.

The Section of the Proxy Statement titled ""The Merger--Background of the Merger"" is hereby supplemented by amending the paragraph on Page 35 that begins ""Since the commencement of the go-shop period, . . ."" as follows to add the underlined sentence:

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Lowinger v. VeriFone Systems, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-00829-UNA. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the section ""Litigation Related to the Merger"" as one of the four lawsuits filed against the Company and its directors. Therefore, the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Supplemental Disclosures"") in order to avoid the expense and distraction of litigation and following discussions with counsel for plaintiffs in the Scarantino and Byrne actions. Although the Target Case is not explicitly mentioned as the reason for the supplemental disclosure, it is one of the four lawsuits mentioned in the same section. Therefore, I will proceed with the assumption that the supplemental disclosure is related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case, I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuits, but I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit.

However, it does not explicitly state that the supplemental disclosure is in response to the lawsuit. But since the supplemental disclosure is related to the Offer and the Merger, and the lawsuit is also related to the Offer, it can be inferred that the supplemental disclosure is in response to the lawsuit.

From time to time, we are a party to litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business. On July 28, 2017, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, against the Company and certain of its current and former executives, captioned Mahoney v. Foundation Medicine, Inc., et al., No. 1:17-cv-11394. The complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder based on allegedly false and misleading statements and omissions when providing 2015 financial guidance. The lawsuit seeks among other things, unspecified compensatory damages in connection with the Company's allegedly inflated stock price between February 26, 2014 and November 3, 2015, interest, attorneys' fees and costs, and unspecified equitable/injunctive relief. On December 22, 2017, the plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder based on allegedly false and misleading statements and omissions concerning providing 2015 financial guidance and other statements during the class period concerning demand and reimbursement for certain of the Company's tests. On February 20, 2018, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, which plaintiffs opposed on April 23, 2018. On June 7, 2018, defendants filed a reply in further support of their motion to dismiss. The court has not yet scheduled oral argument on defendants' motion to dismiss. We believe this case is without merit and, therefore, continue to vigorously defend ourselves against the allegations.

17 | Subsequent Events

On July 10, 2018, the Company and Roche entered into a Seventh Amendment to the R&D Collaboration Agreement, which modified certain capacity and fee provisions related to the molecular information platform program, effective as of April 7, 2018.

On June 19, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 18, 2018, as amended (the ""Merger Agreement""), with Roche Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Parent"" or ""Roche Holdings""), and 062018 Merger Subsidiary, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (""Merger Sub""), providing for the acquisition of the Company by Parent in a two-step all-cash transaction, consisting of a tender offer, followed by a subsequent back-end merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the ""Merger""), with the Company surviving the Merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Roche Holding Ltd. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Parent caused Merger Sub to conduct a tender offer (the ""Offer"") for all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Shares""), of the Company at a price of $137.00 per Share (the ""Offer Price""), net to the seller in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding of taxes, and on the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.

The Offer expired at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, at the end of the day on Monday, July 30, 2018. Citibank, N.A., in its capacity as depositary for the Offer (the ""Depositary""), advised that, as of the expiration of the Offer, a total of 12,535,376 Shares (excluding Shares with respect to which notices of guaranteed delivery were delivered and for which certificates were not yet delivered) were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, representing approximately 77.3% of the Shares outstanding as of the expiration of the Offer (excluding those Shares held by Roche Holdings and its affiliates) and, when taken together with the Shares owned by Roche Holdings and its affiliates, representing approximately 90.1% of the Shares outstanding as of the expiration of the Offer.

Each condition to the Offer was satisfied, and Merger Sub irrevocably accepted for payment all Shares that were validly tendered and not withdrawn.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Kent v. Foundation Medicine, Inc. et al., No. 1:18-cv-01028. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the passage.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since the case was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff, I will proceed to the next step to determine if there was an agreement.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The passage mentions that the plaintiff filed a notice of voluntary dismissal, dismissing the case without prejudice. However, there is no explicit mention of a formal agreement between the Company and the plaintiff.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

Although the case was voluntarily dismissed, there is no strong implication of an agreement between the Company and the plaintiff.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Not applicable, as no agreement was found.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Company did not make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit, and there is no indication of an agreement between the Company and the plaintiff.

On February 20, 2018, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, which plaintiffs opposed on April 23, 2018. On June 7, 2018, defendants filed a reply in further support of their motion to dismiss. The court has not yet scheduled oral argument on defendants' motion to dismiss. We believe this case is without merit and, therefore, continue to vigorously defend ourselves against the allegations.

On July 10, 2018, a putative securities class action complaint, Wang v. Foundation Medicine, Inc. et al., No. 1:18-cv-11435, was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts by purported Company shareholder Elaine Wang against the Company and the Company's directors in connection with the offer by Roche to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock (the ""Offer""). An amended complaint (the ""Wang Complaint"") was filed on July 11, 2018 against the Company, the Company's directors and Roche. The Wang Complaint alleged that the Schedule 14D-9 filed on July 2, 2018 in connection with the Offer omitted certain supposedly material information concerning (1) communications regarding the positions of the Company's directors and officers following the transactions, (2) communications regarding compensation to be paid to the Company's directors and officers in connection with the transactions, and (3) compensation received by Goldman Sachs in connection with the Company's initial public offering and Roche Holdings' 2015 investment in the Company. The Wang Complaint asserted claims against all the defendants for violation of Sections 14(d) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act, and against the Company's directors and Roche Holdings for violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The Wang Complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages and attorneys' fees and costs. On July 31, 2018, the plaintiff filed a notice of voluntary dismissal, dismissing the case with prejudice.

On July 11, 2018, a putative securities class action complaint, Kent v. Foundation Medicine, Inc. et al., No. 1:18-cv-01028 (the ""Kent Complaint""), was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware by purported Company shareholder Michael Kent against the Company, the Company's directors and Roche in connection with the Offer. The Kent Complaint alleged that the Schedule 14D-9 filed on July 2, 2018 in connection with the Offer omitted certain supposedly material information concerning (1) communications regarding the positions of the Company's directors and officers following the transactions and (2) compensation received by Goldman Sachs in connection with the Company's initial public offering and Roche Holdings' 2015 investment in the Company. The Kent Complaint asserted claims against all the defendants for violation of Sections 14(d) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act, and against the Company's directors and Roche for violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The Kent Complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages and attorneys' fees and costs. On August 2, 2018, the plaintiff filed a notice of voluntary dismissal, dismissing the case without prejudice.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. The risk factors described below pertain to us as of the date hereof and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors included in Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. The risk factors included in this Quarterly Report and our Annual Report should be carefully considered although these risks are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. If any such risks or uncertainties actually occur, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, and could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate or decline.

Reimbursement and Regulatory Risks Relating to Our Business

If commercial third-party payors or government payors fail to provide coverage or adequate reimbursement, or if there is a decrease in the extent of coverage or amount of reimbursement for our existing services or any future services we develop, our revenue and prospects for profitability would be harmed.

Overview

In both domestic and many international markets, sales of our existing and any future services we develop will depend, in large part, upon the availability of adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. These third-party payors include government healthcare programs in various markets, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, managed care providers, accountable care organizations, private health insurers, and other organizations. We believe that obtaining a positive Medicare Local Coverage Determination, or LCD, or National Coverage Determination, or NCD, and a favorable Medicare reimbursement rate, and obtaining the agreement of established commercial third-party payors to provide coverage and adequate payment, for each of our existing services, and any future services we develop, across substantially all medically indicated cancers will be a necessary element in achieving material commercial success. Physicians may not order our services unless commercial third-party payors and government payors authorize coverage and pay for all, or a substantial portion, of the rates established for our services.

Commercial third-party payors and government payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by lowering reimbursement rates, limiting coverage of diagnostic services, and creating conditions of reimbursement, such as requiring participation in clinical evidence development involving research studies and the collection of physician decision impact and patient outcomes data. Certain commercial third-party payors may not agree to reimburse our existing services or future services if the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, or the Medicare administrative contractors, or MACs, assigned to the jurisdictions in which our operational laboratory facilities are located do not issue positive coverage decisions, and pay for, such services. As a result of these cost-containment trends, commercial third-party payors and government payors that currently provide, or in the future may provide, reimbursement for one or more of our services may propose and/or actually reduce, suspend, revoke, or discontinue payments or coverage at any time. Payors may also create conditions for coverage or may contract with third-party vendors to manage laboratory benefits, in both cases creating administrative hurdles for ordering physicians and patients that may make our services more difficult to sell. The percentage of submitted claims that are ultimately paid, the length of time to receive payment on claims, and the average reimbursement of those paid claims is likely to vary from period to period.

There is significant uncertainty surrounding whether the use of services that incorporate new technology, such as our portfolio of molecular information services, will be eligible for coverage by commercial third-party payors and government payors or, if eligible for coverage, what the reimbursement rates will be for these services. The fact that a diagnostic service has been approved for reimbursement in the past, has received approval from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, or FDA, or has obtained coverage for any particular indication or in any particular jurisdiction, does not guarantee that such diagnostic service will remain covered and/or reimbursed or that similar or additional diagnostic services and/or clinically indicated tumor types will be covered and/or reimbursed in the future. We have had claims for reimbursement denied by certain commercial third-party payors, in some cases because they have designated some or all of FoundationOne CDx, FoundationOne, FoundationOneHeme, and FoundationACT as experimental and investigational. Reimbursement of next generation sequencing, or NGS, -based cancer tests by commercial third-party payors and government payors may depend on a number of factors, including a payor's determination that our existing and future services are:

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Kent v. Foundation Medicine, Inc. et al., No. 1:18-cv-01028. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the passage.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement or MOU related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. However, I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will check if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. However, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

EXPLANATORY NOTE

On July 23, 2018, Cotiviti Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Cotiviti,"" the ""Company,"" ""we,"" ""us"" or ""our"") filed its definitive proxy statement (the ""Proxy Statement"") with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") relating to the Special Meeting of Stockholders (the ""Special Meeting"") to be held August 24, 2018 to, among other things, approve the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended from time to time, the ""Merger Agreement"") with Verscend Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Verscend""), and Rey Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Verscend (""Merger Sub""), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Cotiviti (the ""Merger""), with Cotiviti continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Verscend.

On July 27, 2018, Eugene Geller, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against the Company and the members of the Company's Board of Directors (the ""Board""), Case No. 1:18-cv-01110-UNA. Subsequently, on August 1, 2018, Jordan Rosenblatt, another purported stockholder of the Company, filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against the Company and the members of the Board, Case No. 1:18-cv-01149-UNA. Additionally, on August 7, 2018, Muriel Karlin, another purported stockholder of the Company, filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against the Company and the members of the Board, Case No. 1:18-cv-01193-UNA. The Company believes the claims set forth in these lawsuits are without merit.

While the Company believes that the disclosure set forth in the Proxy Statement complies fully with applicable law, in order to moot plaintiffs' disclosure claims, avoid nuisance, possible expense and delay, and provide additional information to our stockholders, the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosure set forth below (the ""Supplemental Disclosure""). Nothing in the Supplemental Disclosure shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable law of any of the disclosure set forth herein or in the Proxy Statement. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the litigation that any additional disclosure was or is required.

Supplemental Disclosure to Proxy Statement

The following information should be read in conjunction with the Proxy Statement, which should be read in its entirety. All page references are to pages in the Proxy Statement, and terms used below, unless otherwise defined, have the meanings set forth in the Proxy Statement. Underlined text shows text being added to a reference disclosure in the Proxy Statement and a line through text shows text being deleted from a referenced disclosure in the Proxy Statement.

The Merger -- Background of the Merger

The disclosure under the heading ""The Merger--Background of the Merger"" is hereby supplemented by adding the underlined disclosure to the first full paragraph on page 50 of the Proxy Statement, as follows:

Other potential counterparties who had expressed interest in a potential transaction or who were previously contacted by Goldman Sachs at the direction of the Strategy Committee, declined to participate in the process. Every confidentiality agreement entered into by the Company with a potential counterparty throughout the process included a customary ""standstill"" provision, but those agreements did not prohibit any potential counterparty from making a private request, directly to the Board, at any time, that it be permitted to make a competing proposal. No such potential counterparty ever made any such request. Company management held introductory calls, attended by representatives of Goldman Sachs, with representatives of such parties between April 12, 2018 and April 20, 2018 to provide an overview of the Company and its business.

The disclosure under the heading ""The Merger--Background of the Merger"" is hereby supplemented by adding the underlined disclosure as a new paragraph immediately following the second full paragraph on page 58 of the Proxy Statement, as follows:

The Board also reviewed conflicts disclosures that had been previously provided to the Board by each of Goldman Sachs and William Blair, and did not find any conflicts existed that gave rise to any concern. Goldman Sachs' conflicts disclosure included, among others, its engagement on behalf of Veritas Capital in connection with its pending acquisition of GE Healthcare's Value-Based Care Division. William Blair's conflicts disclosure included a pending engagement on behalf of Veritas Capital in connection with a pending acquisition without identifying the target, but noted that this was William Blair's only engagement on behalf of Veritas Capital in the prior two-year period and indicated the approximate fees expected to be received in connection with such engagement.

The Merger -- Fairness Opinion of Cotiviti's Financial Advisor: Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

The disclosure under the heading ""The Merger--Fairness Opinion of Cotiviti's Financial Advisor: Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC"" is hereby amended and supplemented by adding the underlined disclosure and deleting the lined out disclosure in the second full paragraph on page 69 of the Proxy Statement, as follows:

- **case count**: United States District Court for the District of Delaware
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is Muriel Karlin v. the Company and the members of the Board, Case No. 1:18-cv-01193. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following paragraph:

""Additionally, on August 7, 2018, Muriel Karlin, another purported stockholder of the Company, filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against the Company and the members of the Board, Case No. 1:18-cv-01193-UNA.""

This confirms that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following paragraph:

""While the Company believes that the disclosure set forth in the Proxy Statement complies fully with applicable law, in order to moot plaintiffs' disclosure claims, avoid nuisance, possible expense and delay, and provide additional information to our stockholders, the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosure set forth below (the ""Supplemental Disclosure"").""

This indicates that the Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuits, including the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuits, including the Target Case. However, I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case.

By adding the following disclosure as a new paragraph to the end of each of those sections:

D&B is hereby disclosing certain additional information in the Definitive Proxy Statement in the sections ""The Merger Proposal (Proposal 1) -- Background of the Merger"", ""The Merger Proposal (Proposal 1) -- Opinion of D&B's Financial Advisor"" and ""The Merger Proposal (Proposal 1) -- Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information"" (collectively, the ""Responsive Disclosures"") in response to the three putative class action complaints and the individual stockholder complaint and solely for the purpose of mooting the allegations contained therein. D&B denies the allegations of the three class action complaints and the individual stockholder complaint, and denies any violations of law. D&B believes that the Definitive Proxy Statement disclosed all material information required to be disclosed therein, and denies that the Responsive Disclosures are material or are otherwise required to be disclosed. D&B is disclosing the Responsive Disclosures solely to avoid the expense and distraction of litigation and, following discussions with counsel for plaintiffs in the Kirk and Bird actions, pursuant to confidential memoranda of understanding that D&B and the other named defendants entered into with the named plaintiffs in three of the four actions on October 27, 2018, and with the named plaintiffs in the fourth action on October 28, 2018. Nothing in the Responsive Disclosures shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable law of any of the Responsive Disclosures.

3 | The disclosure in the Definitive Proxy Statement in the section ""The Merger Proposal (Proposal 1) - Background of the Merger"" beginning on page 39 is supplemented as follows:

By amending and restating the first paragraph on page 46 to read as follows:

Following this presentation, the directors, in consultation with J.P. Morgan and Cleary Gottlieb, discussed a bidding process for a potential sale of D&B. This discussion included discussion of the potential utility of a ""go-shop'' structure with a low break-up fee in the merger agreement to provide an opportunity for D&B to conduct an additional market check after public announcement of a transaction for a sale of D&B. The Board discussed how the go-shop would be of value for market checking interest from any prospective third-party bidders that might be willing to make a more attractive offer to acquire all of the equity of D&B. The Board observed that the go-shop process, however, may be of limited, if any, value with respect to a PIPE transaction, given the typical requirement that only a control transaction, not a PIPE, qualify as a superior proposal for purposes of the go-shop and non-solicitation provisions in the merger agreement, as is customary, and for market checking interest from Financial Sponsor C, Financial Sponsor D and Financial Sponsor E, as each had already conducted due diligence and had had ample opportunity to submit to D&B an informed indication of interest to acquire D&B. The Board discussed how the go-shop would be of value for market checking interest from any prospective third-party bidders that might be willing to make a more attractive offer. The Board observed that the go-shop process, however, may be of limited, if any, value for market checking interest from Financial Sponsor C, Financial Sponsor D and Financial Sponsor E, as each had already conducted due diligence and had had ample opportunity to submit to D&B an informed indication of interest to acquire D&B. The Board instructed management and the Board's advisors to continue negotiations with each of Financial Sponsor C and Financial Sponsor D about a PIPE transaction, to continue negotiations with CC Capital about its proposal to acquire all of the equity of D&B, to continue to urge each of Financial Sponsor C and Financial Sponsor D to deliver an indication of interest to acquire all of the equity of D&B, and to continue to be responsive to due diligence requests from and provide due diligence access to each of CC Capital, Financial Sponsor C and Financial Sponsor D, as well as reasonable debt and equity financing sources specified by any of them.

4 | The disclosure in the Definitive Proxy Statement in the section ""The Merger Proposal (Proposal 1) -- Opinion of D&B's Financial Advisor"" beginning on page 56 is supplemented as follows:

By amending and restating the text of the third paragraph on page 59 as follows:

J.P. Morgan applied the FV / CY2019E EBITDA multiple reference range to D&B's estimated calendar year 2019 Core EBITDA as provided and approved by D&B management per the Risk-Adjusted High Probability Plan (see ""Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information"" beginning on page 63), subtracting D&B's net debt of $1.138 billion and minority interest of $16 million as of June 30, 2018 as provided and approved by D&B management, and applied the P / CY2019E EPS multiple reference range to D&B's estimated EPS for calendar year 2019, as provided and approved by D&B management per the risk-adjusted high probability plan.

By amending and restating the last paragraph on page 60 as follows:

After applying such range to D&B's LTM Core EBITDA for the period ended June 30, 2018 as provided and approved by D&B management and calculated in the same manner as Core EBITDA under the Risk-Adjusted High Probability Plan (see ""Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information"" beginning on page 63) and subtracting D&B's net debt of $1.138 billion and minority interest of $16 million as of June 30, 2018, estimated after-tax pension underfunding of $364 million, and estimated after-tax retiree change of control payment of $29 million, all as provided and approved by Company management, the analysis indicated a range of implied per share equity values for D&B common stock (rounded to the nearest $1.00 per share) of $102.00 to $136.00 per share, as compared to the merger consideration of $145.00 per share, D&B's closing share price of $125.82 on August 7, 2018 (the last trading day prior to the day of the announcement of the merger) and D&B's closing share price of $111.63 on February 12, 2018 (the last trading day prior to D&B's quarterly earnings call where D&B indicated that it was ""open to considering all options for value creation that may be identified"").

</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm whether the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts. Upon reviewing the excerpts, I found that the Target Case is mentioned in the added disclosure on page 2, specifically in the section ""Summary Term Sheet -- The Merger -- Litigation Relating to the Merger"" and ""The Merger Proposal (Proposal 1) - Litigation Relating to the Merger"". The case is referred to as one of the ""three putative class action complaints and the individual stockholder complaint"" that the Company is responding to.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. On page 2, the added disclosure states that ""D&B is hereby disclosing certain additional information in the Definitive Proxy Statement... in response to the three putative class action complaints and the individual stockholder complaint and solely for the purpose of mooting the allegations contained therein."" This indicates that the Company is making supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, which includes the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. On page 2, the added disclosure mentions that the Company entered into ""confidential memoranda of understanding"" with the named plaintiffs in three of the four actions on October 27, 2018, and with the named plaintiffs in the fourth action on October 28, 2018. This suggests that the Company reached an agreement with the plaintiffs, but it is not explicitly stated as a ""settlement agreement"".

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

Since there is no explicit ""settlement agreement"", the next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. The added disclosure on page 2 mentions ""confidential memoranda of understanding"", which is a type of agreement.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

Not applicable, as the agreement is explicitly mentioned.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

The agreement is case-specific, and the context around the agreement discussion confirms that it pertains to the Target Case. The added disclosure on page 2 mentions that the Company entered into the memoranda of understanding with the named plaintiffs in the actions, which includes the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, which includes the Target Case. The Company also reached an agreement with the plaintiffs, which is explicitly mentioned as a ""memoranda of understanding"".

The Board observed that the go-shop process, however, may be of limited, if any, value with respect to a PIPE transaction, given the typical requirement that only a control transaction, not a PIPE, qualify as a superior proposal for purposes of the go-shop and non-solicitation provisions in the merger agreement, as is customary, and for market checking interest from Financial Sponsor C, Financial Sponsor D and Financial Sponsor E, as each had already conducted due diligence and had had ample opportunity to submit to D&B an informed indication of interest to acquire D&B. The Board discussed how the go-shop would be of value for market checking interest from any prospective third-party bidders that might be willing to make a more attractive offer. The Board observed that the go-shop process, however, may be of limited, if any, value for market checking interest from Financial Sponsor C, Financial Sponsor D and Financial Sponsor E, as each had already conducted due diligence and had had ample opportunity to submit to D&B an informed indication of interest to acquire D&B. The Board instructed management and the Board's advisors to continue negotiations with each of Financial Sponsor C and Financial Sponsor D about a PIPE transaction, to continue negotiations with CC Capital about its proposal to acquire all of the equity of D&B, to continue to urge each of Financial Sponsor C and Financial Sponsor D to deliver an indication of interest to acquire all of the equity of D&B, and to continue to be responsive to due diligence requests from and provide due diligence access to each of CC Capital, Financial Sponsor C and Financial Sponsor D, as well as reasonable debt and equity financing sources specified by any of them.

4 | The disclosure in the Definitive Proxy Statement in the section ""The Merger Proposal (Proposal 1) -- Opinion of D&B's Financial Advisor"" beginning on page 56 is supplemented as follows:

By amending and restating the text of the third paragraph on page 59 as follows:

J.P. Morgan applied the FV / CY2019E EBITDA multiple reference range to D&B's estimated calendar year 2019 Core EBITDA as provided and approved by D&B management per the Risk-Adjusted High Probability Plan (see ""Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information"" beginning on page 63), subtracting D&B's net debt of $1.138 billion and minority interest of $16 million as of June 30, 2018 as provided and approved by D&B management, and applied the P / CY2019E EPS multiple reference range to D&B's estimated EPS for calendar year 2019, as provided and approved by D&B management per the risk-adjusted high probability plan.

By amending and restating the last paragraph on page 60 as follows:

After applying such range to D&B's LTM Core EBITDA for the period ended June 30, 2018 as provided and approved by D&B management and calculated in the same manner as Core EBITDA under the Risk-Adjusted High Probability Plan (see ""Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information"" beginning on page 63) and subtracting D&B's net debt of $1.138 billion and minority interest of $16 million as of June 30, 2018, estimated after-tax pension underfunding of $364 million, and estimated after-tax retiree change of control payment of $29 million, all as provided and approved by Company management, the analysis indicated a range of implied per share equity values for D&B common stock (rounded to the nearest $1.00 per share) of $102.00 to $136.00 per share, as compared to the merger consideration of $145.00 per share, D&B's closing share price of $125.82 on August 7, 2018 (the last trading day prior to the day of the announcement of the merger) and D&B's closing share price of $111.63 on February 12, 2018 (the last trading day prior to D&B's quarterly earnings call where D&B indicated that it was ""open to considering all options for value creation that may be identified"").

- **case filing date**: 2018-09-26
- **case count**: United States District Court for the District of New Jersey
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm whether the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts. Upon reviewing the excerpts, I found that the Target Case, Bird v. Dun & Bradstreet Corporation et al, is mentioned in the context of the disclosure supplements. Specifically, it is mentioned that the Company is disclosing certain additional information in response to the three putative class action complaints and the individual stockholder complaint, including the Bird action.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company is disclosing certain additional information in the Definitive Proxy Statement in response to the three putative class action complaints and the individual stockholder complaint, including the Bird action. The disclosure is specifically stated to be in response to the lawsuit, and the lawsuit is confirmed to be the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I found that the Company entered into confidential memoranda of understanding with the named plaintiffs in three of the four actions on October 27, 2018, and with the named plaintiffs in the fourth action on October 28, 2018. This suggests that there is an agreement, but it is not explicitly stated as a ""settlement agreement"".

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

Since there is no explicit ""settlement agreement"", the next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I found that the Company entered into confidential memoranda of understanding with the named plaintiffs, which suggests an agreement. However, it is not a formal ""XXX agreement"" in the sense of a named agreement type, but rather a memorandum of understanding.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

Since the agreement is not explicitly stated as a ""settlement agreement"" or a formal ""XXX agreement"", the next step is to determine whether an agreement is strongly implied. I found that the Company entered into confidential memoranda of understanding with the named plaintiffs, which strongly implies an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

The next step is to confirm that the agreement pertains to the Target Case. I found that the agreement is case-specific, and the associated lawsuit is confirmed to be the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, and there is an implied agreement in the form of a memorandum of understanding.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there is a discussion around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Joseph Pietras v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01506-UNA"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the subsection titled ""Certain Litigation"" under Item 8. Therefore, I can confirm that there is a discussion around the Target Case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit. However, I found that the Company has amended and supplemented its Schedule 14D-9 Solicitation/Recommendation Statement by adding a new subsection titled ""Certain Litigation"" and attaching the full complaint as Exhibit (a)(5)(J). This can be considered as a form of supplemental disclosure.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I found a valid supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" since the Company has amended and supplemented its Schedule 14D-9 Solicitation/Recommendation Statement. I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"" since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement.

Explanatory Note

As previously disclosed, subsequent to Essendant filing the Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC, four complaints were filed by purported stockholders of Essendant in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware: Joseph Pietras v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01506-MN, filed September 27, 2018; Patrick Plumley v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01521-MN, filed October 2, 2018; Long Nguyen v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01546-MN, filed October 5, 2018; and Michael J Sultan v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01582-MN, filed October 15, 2018. The complaints name as defendants Essendant and its current directors. In addition, the Plumley complaint names Parent and Purchaser as defendants. The complaints generally allege that the Schedule 14D-9 omits purportedly material information. Each of the complaints seeks, among other things, to enjoin the consummation of the Offer unless and until the requested information is disclosed or, alternatively, to recover damages if the Offer is consummated without the disclosure of such information. Essendant believes that the actions are without merit. The Pietras action was voluntarily dismissed on October 31, 2018.

While Essendant believes that the disclosures set forth in the Schedule 14D-9 comply fully with applicable law, to moot certain of plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Plumley, Nguyen and Sultan actions, to avoid nuisance, potential expense and delay and to provide additional information to its stockholders, Essendant has determined to voluntarily supplement the Schedule 14D-9 with the below disclosures. Nothing in the below supplemental disclosure shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable law of any of the disclosure set forth herein or in the Schedule 14D-9. To the contrary, Essendant denies all allegations in the complaints that any additional disclosure was or is required.

Item 3. | Past Contacts, Transactions, Negotiations and Agreements.

Item 3 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by inserting the following sentence at the end of the subsection entitled ""Interests of Certain Persons; Agreements and Arrangements with Current Executive Officers and Directors of the Company--Potential for Future Arrangements"":

""No discussions or negotiations regarding post-closing employment or directorship with, or the purchase of or participation in the equity of, the Surviving Corporation occurred between Staples and any Company executive officers or directors prior to the approval and execution of the Merger Agreement.""

Item 4. | The Solicitation or Recommendation.

Item 4 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by inserting the following sentence after the sentence beginning with ""Management also reviewed "" in the subsection entitled ""Background and Reasons for the Company Board's Recommendation--Background of the Offer"":

""For more information regarding these projections, see Item 4 under the heading ""Certain Financial Projections.""""

Item 4 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by amending and restating in its entirety the sentence beginning with ""The Management Projections were provided "" in the subsection entitled ""Certain Financial Projections"" as follows:

""The Management Projections were approved by the Company Board in January 2018 and also were provided to the Company's financial advisor, which was directed to use and rely on the Management Projections for purposes of its financial analyses and opinion.""

Item 4 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by amending and restating in its entirety the sentence beginning with ""Citi calculated terminal values for the Company "" in the subsection entitled ""Opinion of Citigroup Global Markets Inc.--Financial Analyses--Discounted Cash Flow Analysis"" as follows:

This indicates that the Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuits, including the Target Case. However, I need to confirm that the supplemental disclosure is specifically in response to the Target Case.

Upon reviewing the text, I found that the Pietras action was voluntarily dismissed on October 31, 2018, but the supplemental disclosure is mentioned in the context of the Plumley, Nguyen, and Sultan actions. However, since the Pietras action is one of the four complaints filed, and the supplemental disclosure is made to moot certain of plaintiffs' disclosure claims, I can infer that the supplemental disclosure is also in response to the Target Case.

Therefore, I can answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

Explanatory Note

As previously disclosed, subsequent to Essendant filing the Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC, four complaints were filed by purported stockholders of Essendant in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware: Joseph Pietras v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01506-MN, filed September 27, 2018; Patrick Plumley v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01521-MN, filed October 2, 2018; Long Nguyen v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01546-MN, filed October 5, 2018; and Michael J Sultan v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01582-MN, filed October 15, 2018. The complaints name as defendants Essendant and its current directors. In addition, the Plumley complaint names Parent and Purchaser as defendants. The complaints generally allege that the Schedule 14D-9 omits purportedly material information. Each of the complaints seeks, among other things, to enjoin the consummation of the Offer unless and until the requested information is disclosed or, alternatively, to recover damages if the Offer is consummated without the disclosure of such information. Essendant believes that the actions are without merit. The Pietras action was voluntarily dismissed on October 31, 2018.

While Essendant believes that the disclosures set forth in the Schedule 14D-9 comply fully with applicable law, to moot certain of plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Plumley, Nguyen and Sultan actions, to avoid nuisance, potential expense and delay and to provide additional information to its stockholders, Essendant has determined to voluntarily supplement the Schedule 14D-9 with the below disclosures. Nothing in the below supplemental disclosure shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable law of any of the disclosure set forth herein or in the Schedule 14D-9. To the contrary, Essendant denies all allegations in the complaints that any additional disclosure was or is required.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is Patrick Plumley v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01521-MN. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the Explanatory Note section. Therefore, I can confirm that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Schedule 14D-9 with additional disclosures to moot certain of plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Plumley, Nguyen, and Sultan actions. The supplemental disclosure is specifically mentioned to be in response to the lawsuits, and the Plumley action is one of the lawsuits mentioned. Therefore, I can confirm that the Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case. Therefore, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement that indicates a resolution. However, I found that the Pietras action was voluntarily dismissed on October 31, 2018. But this is not an agreement, and the reason for the dismissal is not explicitly stated.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement. The voluntary dismissal of the Pietras action does not strongly imply an agreement, as the reason for the dismissal is not explicitly stated.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I do not need to confirm whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I can summarize the results as follows:

* The Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the Target Case.
* There is no explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. In the Explanatory Note section, it is stated that ""to moot certain of plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Plumley, Nguyen and Sultan actions, to avoid nuisance, potential expense and delay and to provide additional information to its stockholders, Essendant has determined to voluntarily supplement the Schedule 14D-9 with the below disclosures."" This indicates that the Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, which includes the Target Case. Therefore, I can answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case. Therefore, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine whether an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement. The fact that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit does not necessarily imply an agreement. Therefore, I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm whether there is any discussion around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. After reviewing the excerpts, I found that the Target Case ""Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc."" is not explicitly mentioned. However, Genuine Parts Company (GPC) is mentioned as the company that will separate its Business Products Group and combine this business with Essendant. This suggests that there might be some relevance, but it is not a direct discussion of the Target Case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

Since the Target Case is not explicitly mentioned, I will proceed with caution. There is no explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. Therefore, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3-6: Search for Explicit Settlement, Other Agreements, and Handle Implied Agreement**

Given that the Target Case is not explicitly mentioned, I will not proceed with searching for explicit settlement, other agreements, or implied agreements.

Staples acknowledges that neither Essendant nor any of its Representatives makes any express or implied representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of any Proprietary Information. Staples also agrees that it is not entitled to rely on the accuracy or completeness of any Proprietary Information and that it shall be entitled to rely solely on such representations and warranties regarding Proprietary Information as may be made to it in a definitive agreement relating to the Transaction, if any, subject to the terms and conditions of such agreement. Nothing contained in this letter agreement nor the conveying of Proprietary Information hereunder shall be construed as granting or conferring any rights by license or otherwise in any intellectual property.

Staples agrees that, for a period of two years from the date of this letter agreement, it shall not, without the prior written consent of Essendant, and shall cause each of its Representatives acting on its behalf not to, without the prior written consent of Essendant, directly or indirectly solicit for employment or hire any of the President and CEO; Senior Vice President and CFO; Senior Vice President, Merchandising, Inventory & Pricing; President, Business and Facility Essentials; Senior Vice President, Chief Human Resources Officer; Senior Vice President, Distribution Operations and Logistics; Group President, Industrial; Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary; Senior Vice President, Strategy and Corporate Development; or Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer now employed by Essendant or any of its subsidiaries with whom Staples or any of its Representatives has contact or who is identified to Staples or any of its Representatives as a result of the discussions contemplated by this letter agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit (i) general solicitations for employment not specifically targeted at Essendant's or any of its subsidiaries' employees or any hiring resulting therefrom, (ii) any solicitation and/or hiring of any person who at the time of such solicitation has not been an employee of Essendant or any of its subsidiaries for a period of six months or more, or (iii) the employment of, or employment discussions with, any person who responds to a solicitation described in clause (i) above.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this letter agreement, Essendant may take any actions required to comply with its obligations under the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 12, 2018, by and among Essendant, Genuine Parts Company, Elephant Merger Sub Corp. and Rhino SpinCo, Inc.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Essendant shall not, and shall direct Essendant's Representatives not to, disclose any Proprietary Information that constitutes material, non-public information to Staples such that purchases or sales of securities of Essendant by Staples while in possession of such information would be unlawful under applicable United States federal securities laws by reason of Staples' possession of such information without first notifying Staples in writing of its intent to do and obtaining Staples' written consent permitting such disclosure.

No contract or agreement with respect to any potential business transaction contemplated by this letter agreement will be deemed to exist between the parties unless and until a definitive agreement with respect thereto has been executed and delivered and, except for the obligations expressly set forth herein, neither party will have any legal obligation of any kind with respect to such a potential transaction or arrangement by virtue of this letter agreement or otherwise. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, Essendant reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to provide or not provide Proprietary Information to Staples and its Representatives under this letter agreement, to reject any and all proposals made by Staples or any of its Representatives with respect to any potential transaction contemplated hereby and to terminate discussions and negotiations with Staples and its Representatives at any time or for any reason with respect to the potential transactions or arrangements.

Each party agrees that the other party would be irreparably injured by a breach of this letter agreement by such party or its Representatives, that monetary remedies would be inadequate to protect the other party against any actual or threatened breach of this letter agreement by such party or by its Representatives, and, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies otherwise available to the other party, such party agrees to the granting of equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, in the other party's favor without proof of actual damages. It is further understood and agreed that no failure or delay by either party in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder.

If any provision of this letter agreement shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, such judgment shall not affect the remainder of this letter agreement.

This letter agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the principles of conflicts of law thereof. The parties agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any dispute arising out of this letter agreement of the courts of the State of Delaware and of the federal courts of the United States located in the State of Delaware, and any appellate court thereof, and to waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that any such dispute has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

No modification of this letter agreement or waiver of the terms and conditions hereof shall be binding upon a party unless approved in writing by such party.

This letter agreement constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this letter agreement. This letter agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the parties and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however, that this letter agreement may not be assigned by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other party hereto, and any attempted assignment without such prior consent shall be void.

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the parties' obligations under this letter agreement shall terminate two years from the date hereof, provided that (i) this paragraph and the prior seven paragraphs shall survive such termination and (ii) no such termination shall relieve either party from liability in respect of breaches by such party prior to such termination.

This letter agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but both of which shall constitute the same agreement. Signatures transmitted electronically shall be accepted as originals for all purposes of this letter agreement.

If you are in agreement with the foregoing, please so indicate by signing and returning one copy of this letter agreement, whereupon this letter agreement will constitute our agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof.

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2018-0730
- **case name**: Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc.
- **case filing date**: 2018-10-10
- **case count**: Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc., Case No. 2018-0730-JRS (Del. Ch.)"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Item 11 under ""Additional Information"" and also in the Exhibit Index as ""(a)(5)(H)"".


**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.


**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a ""settlement"" or ""settlement agreement"" related to the Target Case.


**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. However, I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.


**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will check if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. However, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.


**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will proceed to the next step.


**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will summarize the results as follows:

{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""note"": ""Case mentioned but no discussion of supplemental disclosure or agreement.""

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2018-0730
- **case name**: Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc.
- **case filing date**: 2018-10-10
- **case count**: Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there is a discussion around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc., Case No. 2018-0730-JRS"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit (a)(5)(H) as ""Complaint filed on October 10, 2018 (Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc., Case No. 2018-0730-JRS)"". Therefore, the case is indeed discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any implied agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my review of the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc."" with case number ""2018-0730"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit (a)(5)(H) as ""Complaint filed on October 10, 2018 (Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc., Case No. 2018-0730-JRS)"". Therefore, the case is indeed discussed in the filing.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement or MOU related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. However, I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will check if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. However, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

Here is the JSON object with the final answer:

    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2018-0730
- **case name**: Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc.
- **case filing date**: 2018-10-10
- **case count**: Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm whether the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc."" with case number 2018-0730. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit (a)(5)(H) as ""Complaint filed on October 10, 2018 (Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc., Case No. 2018-0730-JRS)"". Therefore, the Target Case is indeed discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement or MOU related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. However, I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will check if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. However, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my review, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2018-0730
- **case name**: Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc.
- **case filing date**: 2018-10-10
- **case count**: Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc."" with case number 2018-0730. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit (a)(5)(H) as ""Complaint filed on October 10, 2018 (Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc., Case No. 2018-0730-JRS)"". Therefore, the case is indeed discussed in the filing.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement or MOU related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. However, I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will check if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. However, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

Here is the JSON object with the final answer:

{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""note"": ""Case not mentioned in the context of supplemental disclosure or agreement.""

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2018-0730
- **case name**: Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc.
- **case filing date**: 2018-10-10
- **case count**: Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm whether the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc."" with case number 2018-0730. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit (a)(5)(H) as ""Complaint filed on October 10, 2018 (Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc., Case No. 2018-0730-JRS)"". Therefore, the Target Case is indeed discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement or MOU related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. However, I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will check if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. However, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my review, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2018-0730
- **case name**: Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc.
- **case filing date**: 2018-10-10
- **case count**: Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc."" with case number 2018-0730. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit (a)(5)(H) as ""Complaint filed on October 10, 2018 (Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc., Case No. 2018-0730-JRS)"". Therefore, the case is indeed discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my review of the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm whether the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc."" with case number 2018-0730. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit (a)(5)(H) as ""Complaint filed on October 10, 2018 (Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc., Case No. 2018-0730-JRS)"". Therefore, the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any mention of other agreements related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any implied agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I do not need to confirm whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my review of the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm whether there is any discussion around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc."" with case number 2018-0730. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit (a)(5)(H) as ""Complaint filed on October 10, 2018 (Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc., Case No. 2018-0730-JRS)"". This confirms that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any mention of other agreements related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

There is no implied agreement mentioned in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Not applicable since no agreement was found.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the review of the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2018-0730
- **case name**: Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc.
- **case filing date**: 2018-10-10
- **case count**: Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm whether there is any discussion around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc."" with case number 2018-0730. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit (a)(5)(H) as ""Complaint filed on October 10, 2018 (Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc., Case No. 2018-0730-JRS)"".

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. However, upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement or MOU related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will proceed to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. However, upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will check if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. However, upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement or supplemental disclosure related to the Target Case, I will answer ""No"" for both ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""reached_agreement"".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will summarize the results as follows:

{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""note"": ""Case mentioned but no discussion of supplemental disclosure or agreement.""

</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc."" with case number 2018-0730. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit (a)(5)(H) as ""Complaint filed on October 10, 2018 (Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc., Case No. 2018-0730-JRS)"". This confirms that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any mention of other agreements related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any implied agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, I do not need to confirm whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my review of the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc., Case No. 2018-0730-JRS"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in section (a)(5)(H) as ""Complaint filed on October 10, 2018 (Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc., Case No. 2018-0730-JRS)"". Therefore, the case is mentioned in the filing.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any implied agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2018-0730
- **case name**: Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc.
- **case filing date**: 2018-10-10
- **case count**: Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc."" with case number 2018-0730. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit (a)(5)(H) as ""Complaint filed on October 10, 2018 (Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc., Case No. 2018-0730-JRS)"". Therefore, the case is indeed discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

There is no implied agreement suggested in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Not applicable since no agreement was found.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the review of the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc."" with case number 2018-0730. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit (a)(5)(H) as ""Complaint filed on October 10, 2018 (Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc., Case No. 2018-0730-JRS)"". Therefore, the case is indeed discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any mention of other agreements related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

There is no implied agreement mentioned in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Not applicable since no agreement was found.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the review of the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2018-0730
- **case name**: Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc.
- **case filing date**: 2018-10-10
- **case count**: Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc."" with case number 2018-0730. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit (a)(5)(H) as ""Complaint filed on October 10, 2018 (Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc., Case No. 2018-0730-JRS)"". Therefore, the case is discussed in the filing.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any implied agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2018-0730
- **case name**: Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc.
- **case filing date**: 2018-10-10
- **case count**: Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc."" with case number 2018-0730. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit (a)(5)(H) as ""Complaint filed on October 10, 2018 (Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc., Case No. 2018-0730-JRS)"".

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. However, upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement or MOU related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. However, upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will check if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. However, upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement or supplemental disclosure related to the Target Case, I will answer ""No"" for both ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""reached_agreement"".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I did not find any evidence of supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",

- **case number**: 2018-0730

</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm whether the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc."" with case number 2018-0730. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit (a)(5)(H) as ""Complaint filed on October 10, 2018 (Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc., Case No. 2018-0730-JRS)"". Therefore, the Target Case is indeed discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

There is no strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Not applicable since no agreement was found.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the review of the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2018-0730
- **case name**: Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc.
- **case filing date**: 2018-10-10
- **case count**: Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm whether there is any discussion around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc."" with case number 2018-0730. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit (a)(5)(H) as ""Complaint filed on October 10, 2018 (Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc., Case No. 2018-0730-JRS)"". This confirms that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I did not find any evidence of supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2018-0730
- **case name**: Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc.
- **case filing date**: 2018-10-10
- **case count**: Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm whether there is any discussion around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc."" with case number 2018-0730. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit (a)(5)(H) as ""Complaint filed on October 10, 2018 (Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc., Case No. 2018-0730-JRS)"". Therefore, the Target Case is indeed discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my review of the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```

    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc."" with case number 2018-0730. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit (a)(5)(H) as ""Complaint filed on October 10, 2018 (Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc., Case No. 2018-0730-JRS)"". Therefore, the case is discussed in the filing.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any implied agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my review of the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```

    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm whether there is any discussion around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc."" with case number 2018-0730. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit (a)(5)(H) as ""Complaint filed on October 10, 2018 (Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc., Case No. 2018-0730-JRS)"". Therefore, the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

There is no implied agreement mentioned in the Filing Excerpts related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my review of the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

Essendant believes that the FTC has issued Sycamore a second request with respect to this filing.

Cautionary Statements

This report contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the proposed business combination transaction between Essendant Inc. (""Essendant"") and Genuine Parts Company (""GPC"") in which GPC will separate its Business Products Group and combine this business with Essendant. From time to time, oral or written forward-looking statements may also be included in other information released to the public. These forward-looking statements are intended to provide management's current expectations or plans for our future operating and financial performance, based on assumptions currently believed to be valid.

In 2017, the Company was named in a class action lawsuit filed by a former employee in the Los Angeles Superior Court. During the second quarter of 2017, the parties finalized a settlement agreement, which was subject to court approval. On May 10, 2018, the court granted the parties' Motion for Preliminary Approval of the settlement agreement. Notice to the class was issued on May 31, 2018. In consideration of the settlement, in the second quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a $3.0 million pre-tax reserve within ""Warehousing, marketing and administrative expenses"" in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. On September 28, 2018, the court entered a Final Approval Order approving the terms of the settlement agreement. On October 5, 2018, the Company funded the settlement and transmitted the gross settlement amount of $3.0 million to the Settlement Administrator.

On September 24, 2018, ESND filed its Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the ""Schedule 14D-9"") with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") in connection with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 14, 2018 (the ""Merger Agreement""), by and among ESND, Egg Parent Inc. (""Parent""), Egg Merger Sub Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (""Purchaser""), and Staples, Inc., an affiliate of Parent and Purchaser (""Staples""), pursuant to which, among other things, Purchaser has agreed to acquire ESND through the Offer (as defined below). Subsequent to ESND filing the Schedule 14D-9, various complaints have been filed by purported stockholders of ESND. As of October 23, 2018, ESND had received the following complaints, each filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware: Joseph Pietras v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01506-MN, filed September 27, 2018; Patrick Plumley v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01521-MN, filed October 2, 2018; Long Nguyen v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01546-MN, filed October 5, 2018; and Michael J Sultan v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01582-MN, filed October 15, 2018. The complaints name as defendants ESND and its current directors. In addition, the Plumley complaint names Parent and Purchaser as defendants. The complaints generally allege that the Schedule 14D-9 omits purportedly material information. Each of the complaints seeks, among other things, to enjoin the consummation of the Offer unless and until the requested information is disclosed or, alternatively, to recover damages if the Offer is consummated without the disclosure of such information.

On October 10, 2018, ESND was named in a lawsuit filed by Genuine Parts Company (""GPC"") in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in connection with the termination of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 12, 2018 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the ""GPC Merger Agreement""), by and among GPC, Rhino SpinCo, Inc., ESND and Elephant Merger Sub Corp., and the subsequent entry by ESND into the Merger Agreement. In its complaint, GPC alleges that ESND breached the GPC Merger Agreement by, among other things, purportedly (i) encouraging and engaging in ongoing negotiations with Sycamore Partners, the owner of Staples, and terminating the GPC Merger Agreement on the basis of an allegedly inferior proposal by Sycamore Partners; (ii) entering into a confidentiality agreement with Staples that, in GPC's view, does not contain terms at least as restrictive as those contained in the confidentiality agreement between ESND and GPC; and (iii) failing to exercise its reasonable best efforts to close the merger contemplated by the GPC Merger Agreement. The complaint seeks an award of compensatory damages, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and reimbursement of costs and expenses incurred by GPC, including reasonable attorneys' fees. For more information on the termination of the GPC Merger Agreement and subsequent entry into the Merger Agreement, see Note 15 - ""Pending Transaction Activity.""

The Company is also involved in other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of, or incidental to its business. The Company has established reserves, which are not material, for potential losses that are probable and reasonably estimable that may result from those proceedings. In many cases, however, it is difficult to determine whether a loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount or range of potential loss, particularly where proceedings may be in relatively early stages or where plaintiffs are seeking substantial or indeterminate damages. Matters frequently need to be more developed before a loss or range of loss can reasonably be estimated. The Company believes that such ordinary course legal proceedings will be resolved with no material adverse effect upon its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

14. Independent reseller channel investments

The Company invested $23.6 million, including a $1.6 million note, in the nine months of September 30, 2018, respectively, in the independent reseller channel as part of the Company strategy to accelerate sales performance in key channels. The Company recognizes its share of the earnings and losses of its investees in ""Interest and other expense, net"" in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and includes the investments in ""Other assets"" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The carrying value of the investments will be subsequently adjusted to reflect the Company's share of earnings and losses, other-than-temporary impairments and changes in capital of the investees.

15. Pending Transaction Activity

On April 12, 2018, ESND announced it entered into the GPC Merger Agreement, pursuant to which ESND would combine with GPC's S.P. Richards Company business in a business combination transaction. A description of the material terms of the GPC Merger Agreement can be found in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by ESND on April 12, 2018.

On September 9, 2018, Parent and Purchaser delivered to ESND a binding offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of ESND's common stock, par value $0.10 per share (the ""ESND Common Stock""), at a price of $12.80 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest (the ""Offer Price""), subject to any applicable tax deduction or withholding (the ""Binding Offer""). On September 10, 2018, ESND notified GPC that ESND had determined that the Binding Offer constituted a ""Superior Proposal"" under the GPC Merger Agreement.

On September 14, 2018, ESND entered into the Merger Agreement with Parent, Purchaser and Staples. The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of Purchaser with and into ESND, with ESND surviving the merger as the surviving corporation (the ""Merger""). A description of the material terms of the Merger Agreement can be found in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by ESND on September 17, 2018.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, on September 24, 2018, Purchaser commenced a tender offer (the ""Offer"") to purchase all of the outstanding shares of ESND Common Stock at the Offer Price, subject to any applicable tax deduction or withholding. On September 24, 2018, Purchaser, Parent and Staples filed a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with the SEC relating to the Offer, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated September 24, 2018, and in the related Letter of Transmittal. Also on September 24, 2018, ESND filed a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 recommending that holders of ESND Common Stock accept the Offer and tender their shares in response to the Offer. The Offer was initially scheduled to expire at one minute after 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on October 22, 2018, but has been extended to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 5, 2018. The Offer may be extended further in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.

The Merger Agreement provides that, immediately following the acceptance for payment for all ESND Common Stock validly tendered pursuant to the Offer (the ""Offer Closing""), the parties to the Merger Agreement will take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective immediately following the Offer Closing without a stockholders' meeting in accordance with Section 251(h) of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

Upon the effective time of the Merger, each share of ESND Common Stock (except for shares held by Parent, ESND and Purchaser, which will be cancelled and cease to exist, and by stockholders who exercise their appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there is a discussion around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc."" with a case number of 2018-0730, filed on October 10, 2018, in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found a mention of this case in the section discussing the lawsuit filed by Genuine Parts Company (GPC) against ESND.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement or MOU related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. However, I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will check if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. However, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

Several lawsuits have been filed in connection with the Transactions.

ESND and its directors are named as defendants in several lawsuits brought by purported stockholders challenging the Offer and seeking, among other things, to enjoin the consummation of the Offer. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Offer is that no order by any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction, such as a court, will exist at the expiration of the Offer that prohibits, restrains, enjoins or makes illegal the consummation of the Offer or the Merger. As such, if any of the plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the Offer, then such an injunction may delay the consummation of the Offer in the expected timeframe or may prevent the Offer from being consummated altogether.

Additionally, ESND has been named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by Genuine Parts Company (""GPC"") in connection with the termination of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 12, 2018 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the ""GPC Merger Agreement""), by and among GPC, Rhino SpinCo, Inc., ESND and Elephant Merger Sub Corp., and the subsequent entry by ESND into the Merger Agreement. In its complaint, GPC seeks an award of compensatory damages, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and reimbursement of costs and expenses incurred by GPC, including reasonable attorneys' fees.

No assurance can be made as to the outcome of any of these lawsuits, including the amount of costs associated with defending these claims or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the litigation of these claims. For more information on these lawsuits, see Note 13 - ""Legal Matters.""

ESND's rights plan and certain anti-takeover provisions contained in ESND's certificate of incorporation, ESND's bylaws and under Delaware law could hinder a competing takeover attempt.

On May 17, 2018, ESND's board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan, as subsequently amended on May 29, 2018 and September 14, 2018, between ESND and Equiniti Trust Company, as rights agent (the ""Rights Plan""). Pursuant to the Rights Plan, one preferred stock purchase right (a ""Right"") was distributed as a dividend on each share of ESND Common Stock held of record as of the close of business on May 27, 2018. Each Right entitles ESND stockholders to purchase a unit representing one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock for $33.00 per unit, subject to adjustment.

The Rights generally will be exercisable only if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership (including through derivatives) of 10% or more (or 15% or more for a person or group reporting beneficial ownership on Schedule 13G) of ESND Common Stock or commences a tender or exchange offer upon consummation of which such person or group would beneficially own 10% or more of ESND Common Stock. The Rights expire on May 17, 2019, unless earlier redeemed, exchanged or terminated. The Rights Plan is structured such that it will not be triggered by the Transactions.

Although ESND's board of directors believes that, given current circumstances, it is in the best interests of stockholders that no one person or group acquire undue influence or control through purchases of ESND Common Stock (other than pursuant to the Offer), the Rights Plan could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control (other than pursuant to the Offer). For example, such provisions may deter tender offers for shares of ESND Common Stock or exchangeable shares, which offers may be attractive to stockholders, or deter purchases of large blocks of ESND Common Stock or exchangeable shares, thereby limiting the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of ESND Common Stock or exchangeable shares over the then-prevailing market prices resulting from alternative transactions.

ESND is subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibiting, under some circumstances, publicly-held Delaware corporations from engaging in business combinations with certain interested stockholders unless certain approvals are obtained. Such provisions could delay or impede the removal of incumbent directors and could make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving ESND, even if such events could be beneficial, in the short-term, to the interests of the stockholders. In addition, such provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of ESND Common Stock. Additionally, ESND's certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions relating to the limitations of liability and indemnification of ESND's directors and officers and dividing its board of directors into three classes of directors serving three-year terms. These provisions also may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control or management of ESND.

The Transactions may discourage other companies from trying to acquire ESND before completion of the Transactions.

Certain provisions in the Merger Agreement prohibit ESND from soliciting any acquisition proposal during the pendency of the Merger. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under circumstances that obligate ESND to pay Parent a termination fee, ESND's financial condition will be adversely affected as a result of the payment of the termination fee, which might deter third parties from proposing alternative acquisition proposals, including acquisition proposals that might result in greater value to ESND stockholders than the Transactions.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Genuine Parts Company v. Essendant Inc."" filed on 2018-10-10 in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following paragraph:

""Additionally, ESND has been named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by Genuine Parts Company (""GPC"") in connection with the termination of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 12, 2018 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the ""GPC Merger Agreement""), by and among GPC, Rhino SpinCo, Inc., ESND and Elephant Merger Sub Corp., and the subsequent entry by ESND into the Merger Agreement.""

This confirms that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement or MOU related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will proceed to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will proceed to check if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will conclude that there is no agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I conclude that:

* There is no supplemental disclosure related to the merger in response to the lawsuit.
* There is no agreement related to the Target Case.

Explanatory Note

As previously disclosed, subsequent to Essendant filing the Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC, four complaints were filed by purported stockholders of Essendant in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware: Joseph Pietras v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01506-MN, filed September 27, 2018; Patrick Plumley v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01521-MN, filed October 2, 2018; Long Nguyen v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01546-MN, filed October 5, 2018; and Michael J Sultan v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01582-MN, filed October 15, 2018. The complaints name as defendants Essendant and its current directors. In addition, the Plumley complaint names Parent and Purchaser as defendants. The complaints generally allege that the Schedule 14D-9 omits purportedly material information. Each of the complaints seeks, among other things, to enjoin the consummation of the Offer unless and until the requested information is disclosed or, alternatively, to recover damages if the Offer is consummated without the disclosure of such information. Essendant believes that the actions are without merit. The Pietras action was voluntarily dismissed on October 31, 2018.

While Essendant believes that the disclosures set forth in the Schedule 14D-9 comply fully with applicable law, to moot certain of plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Plumley, Nguyen and Sultan actions, to avoid nuisance, potential expense and delay and to provide additional information to its stockholders, Essendant has determined to voluntarily supplement the Schedule 14D-9 with the below disclosures. Nothing in the below supplemental disclosure shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable law of any of the disclosure set forth herein or in the Schedule 14D-9. To the contrary, Essendant denies all allegations in the complaints that any additional disclosure was or is required.

Item 3. | Past Contacts, Transactions, Negotiations and Agreements.

Item 3 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by inserting the following sentence at the end of the subsection entitled ""Interests of Certain Persons; Agreements and Arrangements with Current Executive Officers and Directors of the Company--Potential for Future Arrangements"":

""No discussions or negotiations regarding post-closing employment or directorship with, or the purchase of or participation in the equity of, the Surviving Corporation occurred between Staples and any Company executive officers or directors prior to the approval and execution of the Merger Agreement.""

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Michael J Sultan v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01582-MN. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the Explanatory Note section. Therefore, I can confirm that the Target Case is discussed in the filing.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. In the Explanatory Note section, it is stated that ""to moot certain of plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Plumley, Nguyen and Sultan actions, to avoid nuisance, potential expense and delay and to provide additional information to its stockholders, Essendant has determined to voluntarily supplement the Schedule 14D-9 with the below disclosures."" This indicates that the Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, which includes the Target Case. Therefore, I can answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case. Therefore, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case. Therefore, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine whether an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement. The fact that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit does not necessarily imply an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement, I do not need to confirm whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my analysis, I can summarize the results as follows:

* The Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, which includes the Target Case.
* There is no explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

The Pietras Chancery Complaint alleges that the Company Board breached its fiduciary duties and/or otherwise violated Delaware law (and that Sycamore Partners, Staples, Parent and Purchaser colluded in or aided and abetted in such violations) by, among other things, purportedly (i) failing to obtain the highest value available for the Company in the marketplace; (ii) initiating a process to sell the Company that purportedly undervalues the Company and vests the Company Board with benefits that are not shared equally by the Company's public stockholders; (iii) failing to provide in the Schedule 14D-9 all material information necessary for the Company's public stockholders to decide whether to tender their Shares in the Offer; and (iv) committing waste by approving the Contemplated Transactions. The Pietras Chancery Complaint seeks to enjoin the closing of the Offer unless and until the Company adopts a procedure to obtain a purportedly fairer agreement and discloses the requested information in the Schedule 14D-9 or, alternatively, to recover damages if the Offer closes without the adoption of such a procedure and the disclosure of such information.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Joseph Pietras v. Richard D. Phillips, et al., Case No. 2018-0789"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the subsection titled ""Certain Litigation"" under Item 8. Therefore, I can confirm that the Target Case is discussed in the filing.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the Company has amended and supplemented Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 by inserting additional disclosure at the end of the subsection titled ""Certain Litigation"". This suggests that the Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit. However, I need to confirm that the lawsuit is the Target Case. The filing mentions that the Pietras Chancery Complaint was filed on October 31, 2018, which matches the case filing date of the Target Case. Therefore, I can confirm that the supplemental disclosure is associated with the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

Since I did not find any explicit settlement, the next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement.

The complaints name as defendants Essendant and its current directors. In addition, the Plumley complaint names Parent and Purchaser as defendants.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Joseph Pietras v. Richard D. Phillips, et al., Case No. 2018-0789"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case ""Joseph Pietras v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01506-MN"" is mentioned, which seems to be related to the Target Case. However, the case number and court are different. I will proceed with caution.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to look for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Schedule 14D-9 with additional disclosures to moot certain of plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Plumley, Nguyen and Sultan actions. The supplemental disclosure is specifically in response to the lawsuits, but it is not clear if it is associated with the Target Case.

However, I found that the Pietras action was voluntarily dismissed on October 31, 2018, which is the same filing date as the Target Case. This suggests that the supplemental disclosure might be related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" because the Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuits, and it is likely associated with the Target Case.

For ""reached_agreement"", I will answer ""No"" because I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

Item 8.01 | Other Events.

On November 12, 2018, Albert B. Ratner filed a complaint against Forest City Realty Trust, Inc. (""Forest City"") in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the caption Albert B. Ratner v Forest City Realty Trust, Inc., Case No. 1:18-CV-02605. The complaint alleged that the definitive proxy statement provided to stockholders of Forest City in connection with the pending acquisition of Forest City by a Brookfield Asset Management Inc. real estate investment fund was materially misleading. On November 13, 2018, Mr. Ratner filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Forest City stockholder vote to approve the pending acquisition until 30 days after certain supplemental disclosures were made. On November 14, 2018, Forest City filed a brief in opposition to the motion.

After reviewing the above submissions, on November 14, 2018, Judge Christopher A. Boyko issued an order denying the motion. Accordingly, the special meeting of Forest City stockholders to consider and vote upon the approval of the acquisition will be held as scheduled, tomorrow, November 15, 2018, at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time at the 39th Floor, Lakeview Room, located in the offices of Thompson Hine LLP, Key Tower, 127 Public Square, Cleveland, Ohio 44114.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements in this communication, including, without limitation, statements regarding the proposed acquisition of Forest City by an entity affiliated with a Brookfield Asset Management Inc. real estate investment fund (the ""proposed transaction""), plans and objectives, and management's beliefs, expectations or opinions, may contain forward-looking information within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements relate to future, not past, events and often address expected future actions and expected future business and financial performance. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as ""potential,"" ""expect,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""may,"" ""subject to,"" ""continues,"" ""if"" and similar words and phrases.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there is a discussion around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Albert B. Ratner v Forest City Realty Trust, Inc., Case No. 1:18-CV-02605"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the section ""Item 8.01 | Other Events"". Therefore, I can confirm that there is a discussion around the Target Case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. In the section ""Item 8.01 | Other Events"", I found that the plaintiff, Albert B. Ratner, filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Forest City stockholder vote to approve the pending acquisition until 30 days after certain supplemental disclosures were made. However, there is no mention that the Company agreed or planned to make supplemental disclosure. Instead, the Company filed a brief in opposition to the motion, and the judge denied the motion. Therefore, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any valid supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement or a memorandum of understanding (MOU) related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. However, I did not find any mention of such an agreement.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will check if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. However, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will summarize the results as follows:

{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",

Item 8.01 | Other Events.

On November 12, 2018, Albert B. Ratner filed a complaint against Forest City Realty Trust, Inc. (""Forest City"") in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the caption Albert B. Ratner v Forest City Realty Trust, Inc., Case No. 1:18-CV-02605. The complaint alleged that the definitive proxy statement provided to stockholders of Forest City in connection with the pending acquisition of Forest City by a Brookfield Asset Management Inc. real estate investment fund was materially misleading. On November 13, 2018, Mr. Ratner filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Forest City stockholder vote to approve the pending acquisition until 30 days after certain supplemental disclosures were made. On November 14, 2018, Forest City filed a brief in opposition to the motion.

After reviewing the above submissions, on November 14, 2018, Judge Christopher A. Boyko issued an order denying the motion. Accordingly, the special meeting of Forest City stockholders to consider and vote upon the approval of the acquisition will be held as scheduled, tomorrow, November 15, 2018, at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time at the 39th Floor, Lakeview Room, located in the offices of Thompson Hine LLP, Key Tower, 127 Public Square, Cleveland, Ohio 44114.

Litigation Related to the Merger

In connection with the Merger, after the Definitive Proxy Statement was filed, four stockholder class action lawsuits have been filed:

The Complaints seek, among other things, additional disclosure of facts relating to the Merger and/or injunctive relief. Additional similar lawsuits may be filed in the future. The Company believes that the plaintiffs' allegations in the Complaints lack merit and will vigorously defend against these and any subsequently filed similar actions. If additional similar complaints are filed, absent new or different allegations that are material, the Company will not necessarily disclose such additional filings.

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since the Target Case is mentioned, the next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

Litigation Related to the Merger

In connection with the Merger, after the Definitive Proxy Statement was filed, four stockholder class action lawsuits have been filed:

(i) | in the United States District Court of Delaware, captioned Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00138-UNA (the ""Sabatini Complaint"");

(ii) | in California Superior Court of San Luis Obispo County, captioned Schmit v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 19CV-0043 (the ""Schmit Complaint"");

(iii) | in the United States District Court of Central District of California, captioned Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2:19-cv-00638 (the ""Tran Complaint""); and

(iv) | in the Court of Chancery of Delaware, captioned Ryan v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2019-0061 (the ""Ryan Complaint,"" and together with the Sabatini Complaint, Schmit Complaint, and Tran Complaint, the ""Complaints"")

The Complaints generally allege, among other things, that MINDBODY and the members of its Board of Directors purportedly omitted material information from the Proxy Statement and that the Merger and the process that led to it was procedurally and substantively flawed. The Complaints also allege claims against the members of the Company's Board of Directors and, in the case of the Ryan Complaint, Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC. The Complaints seek, among other things, additional disclosure of facts relating to the Merger and/or injunctive relief. Additional similar lawsuits may be filed in the future. The Company believes that the plaintiffs' allegations in the Complaints lack merit and will vigorously defend against these and any subsequently filed similar actions. If additional similar complaints are filed, absent new or different allegations that are material, the Company will not necessarily disclose such additional filings. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Complaints which are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, 99.3 and 99.4 and incorporated by reference herein.

Additional Information and Where to Find It

Promptly after filing its definitive proxy statement with the SEC, MINDBODY mailed the definitive proxy statement and a proxy card to each stockholder of MINDBODY entitled to vote at the special meeting relating to the proposed transaction. The proxy statement contains important information about the proposed Merger and related matters. STOCKHOLDERS AND SECURITY HOLDERS OF MINDBODY ARE URGED TO READ THESE MATERIALS (INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO) AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER THAT MINDBODY WILL FILE WITH THE SEC WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT MINDBODY AND THE TRANSACTION.

Before making any voting decision, stockholders of MINDBODY are urged to read the proxy statement regarding the Merger and any other relevant documents filed with the SEC, as well as any amendments or supplements to those documents, because they will contain important information about the proposed Merger.

Stockholders of MINDBODY are able to obtain a free copy of the proxy statement, as well as other filings containing information about MINDBODY and the proposed transaction, without charge, at the SEC's website (http://www.sec.gov).

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al."" with case number ""1:19-cv-00138"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit 99.1, which is a complaint filed on January 24, 2019. Therefore, the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

There is no implied agreement mentioned in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since there is no agreement mentioned, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I did not find any evidence of supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

The Ryan Complaint alleges, among other things, that the irrevocable proxies granted by Richard Stollmeyer, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company Board, certain parties related to Richard Stollmeyer, and Institutional Venture Partners XIII, L.P. (the ""Signing Stockholders"") caused a transfer of voting control of the Signing Stockholders' Class B common stock, which in turn caused the Signing Stockholders' shares of Class B common stock to be automatically converted into shares of Class A common stock entitled to one vote for each such share of Class A common stock, as opposed to ten votes for each share of Class B common stock. If, as alleged in the Ryan Complaint, the Class B common stock held by the Signing Stockholders were converted into shares of Class A common stock, then, as of the Record Date: (i) there would have been 47,763,583 shares of Class A common stock and 252,950 shares of Class B common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, (ii) 25,146,542 votes would constitute a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY common stock required to adopt the Merger Agreement and the holders of such majority of the voting power would constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting, (iii) the Signing Stockholders would have held, in the aggregate, approximately 6.33% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY's common stock (and approximately 8.43% when taking into account MINDBODY options and RSUs held, in the aggregate, by the Signing Stockholders), and (iv) our directors and executive officers would have held, in the aggregate, approximately 1.33% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY's common stock (and approximately 9.33% when taking into account MINDBODY options and RSUs held, in the aggregate, by our directors and executive officers). The Company vigorously disputes the allegations in the Ryan Complaint and the claim that the Signing Stockholders' shares of Class B common stock were converted into Class A common stock, and believes that the numbers and percentages as of the Record Date are as set forth in the Proxy Statement. However, even if the Class B common stock were converted into Class A common stock as alleged in the Ryan Complaint, the Board of Directors nonetheless encourages stockholders to vote ""FOR"" the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the other proposals set forth in the Proxy Statement.

As previously disclosed in the Company's Schedule 14A, also filed on January 29, 2019, counsel for Luxor Capital Partners, LP, Luxor Wavefront, LP, Lugard Road Capital Master Fund, LP, Luxor Capital Partners Offshore Master Fund, LP, Luxor Capital Partners Offshore, Ltd., Luxor Capital Group, LP, LCG Holdings, LLC, Lugard Road Capital GP, LLC and Luxor Management, LLC (together, ""Luxor"") sent a demand letter (""the Luxor Demand Letter"") to MINDBODY pursuant to Section 220(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (""DGCL"").

After the Company's January 29th filings, on January 30, 2019, Luxor filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of Delaware, captioned Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc., Case No. 2019-0070 (the ""Luxor Complaint""), included below, on January 31, 2019, Hyan Tang, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a putative class action suit in the United States District Court of Delaware, captioned Tang v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00210-UNA (the ""Tang Complaint""), included below; and on February 4, 2019, Sunil Kumar, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a putative class action suit in the United States District Court of the Central District of California, captioned Kumar v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. (the ""Kumar Complaint,"" included below, and together with the Sabatini Complaint, the Schmit Complaint, the Tran Complaint, the Ryan Complaint, the Luxor Complaint and the Tang Complaint, the ""Complaints"").

The following documents in connection with the Luxor Complaint are also included below: Luxor's Motion to Expedite, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on January 30, 2019, Luxor's Statement of Good Cause, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on January 30, 2019, MINDBODY's Opposition to Luxor's Motion to Expedite, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on February 1, 2019, Luxor's Reply to MINDBODY's Opposition, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on February 4, 2019, and the Order of the Court of Chancery of Delaware, granted on February 4, 2019.

The Company believes the Complaints are without merit, and the Company has vigorously defended and continues to vigorously defend against the Complaints.

While the Company believes that the disclosures set forth in the Proxy Statement comply fully with applicable law, in order to moot plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Complaints, avoid nuisance and possible expense, and provide additional information to the Company's stockholders, the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Supplemental Disclosures""). Nothing in the Supplemental Disclosures shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the Complaints that any additional disclosure was or is required.

Supplemental Disclosures to Proxy Statement

The following supplemental information should be read in conjunction with the Proxy Statement, which should be read in its entirety. All page references are to pages in the Proxy Statement, and terms used below, unless otherwise defined, have the meanings set forth in the Proxy Statement. Underlined text shows text being added to a referenced disclosure in the Proxy Statement and a line through text shows text being deleted from a referenced disclosure in the Proxy Statement.

The disclosure under the heading ""The Merger--Background of the Merger"" is hereby supplemented by adding the underlined disclosure after the first paragraph under that heading on page 26 of the Proxy Statement:

In the first half of August 2018, as part of Qatalyst Partners' customary coverage of software companies, a representative of Qatalyst Partners had a meeting with Mr. Stollmeyer. Following this meeting, Qatalyst Partners reached out to Vista, Party A, and Party B as typical outreach to connect strategic companies, including MINDBODY, to such parties.

Separately, on August 7, 2018, a representative of Vista emailed Mr. Stollmeyer, offering to meet for lunch, which took place on September 4, 2018, and at which Mr. Stollmeyer provided the representative of Vista with a general overview of MINDBODY and its approach to the fitness, beauty and wellness services industries as was typical for Mr. Stollmeyer to present to potential investors.

On September 19, 2018, Mr. Stollmeyer received an invitation from the representative of Vista to attend an annual ""meet and greet"" conference hosted by Vista bringing together hundreds of executives in the technology sector, including from Vista's portfolio companies.

The disclosure under the heading ""The Merger--Background of the Merger"" is hereby supplemented by adding the underlined disclosure in the second paragraph under that heading on page 26 of the Proxy Statement:

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00138. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the Target Case is not explicitly mentioned. However, the Filing Excerpts do mention other cases, such as the Luxor Complaint, the Tang Complaint, and the Kumar Complaint, but not the Sabatini case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

Since the Target Case is not mentioned, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and proceed to the next step.

**Step 3-7: Not Applicable**

Since the Target Case is not mentioned, I will not proceed with the remaining steps.

The Complaints generally allege, among other things, that MINDBODY and the members of its Board of Directors purportedly omitted material information from the Proxy Statement and that the Merger and the process that led to it was procedurally and substantively flawed. The Complaints also allege claims against the members of the Company's Board of Directors and, in the case of the Ryan Complaint, Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC. The Complaints seek, among other things, additional disclosure of facts relating to the Merger and/or injunctive relief. Additional similar lawsuits may be filed in the future. The Company believes that the plaintiffs' allegations in the Complaints lack merit and will vigorously defend against these and any subsequently filed similar actions. If additional similar complaints are filed, absent new or different allegations that are material, the Company will not necessarily disclose such additional filings. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Complaints which are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, 99.3 and 99.4 and incorporated by reference herein.

Additional Information and Where to Find It

The proxy statement contains important information about the proposed Merger and related matters. STOCKHOLDERS AND SECURITY HOLDERS OF MINDBODY ARE URGED TO READ THESE MATERIALS (INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO) AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER THAT MINDBODY WILL FILE WITH THE SEC WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT MINDBODY AND THE TRANSACTION.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al."" with case number 2:19-cv-00638. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following paragraph:

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will proceed to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will proceed to check if an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al."" with case number 2:19-cv-00638. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit 99.3 as ""Complaint, Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2:19-cv-00638, filed on January 28, 2019"". Therefore, the Target Case is mentioned in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

The Complaints generally allege, among other things, that MINDBODY and the members of its Board of Directors purportedly omitted material information from the Proxy Statement and that the Merger and the process that led to it was procedurally and substantively flawed. The Complaints also allege claims against the members of the Company's Board of Directors and, in the case of the Ryan Complaint, Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC. The Complaints seek, among other things, additional disclosure of facts relating to the Merger and/or injunctive relief. Additional similar lawsuits may be filed in the future. The Company believes that the plaintiffs' allegations in the Complaints lack merit and will vigorously defend against these and any subsequently filed similar actions. If additional similar complaints are filed, absent new or different allegations that are material, the Company will not necessarily disclose such additional filings. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Complaints which are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, 99.3 and 99.4 and incorporated by reference herein.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2:19-cv-00638"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the section describing the complaints filed against MINDBODY.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will not proceed with confirming whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al."" with case number 2:19-cv-00638. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit 99.3 as ""Complaint, Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2:19-cv-00638, filed on January 28, 2019"". Therefore, the Target Case is mentioned in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. However, I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will check if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. However, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will summarize the results as follows:

{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""note"": ""Case mentioned but no discussion of supplemental disclosure or agreement.""

The Ryan Complaint alleges, among other things, that the irrevocable proxies granted by Richard Stollmeyer, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company Board, certain parties related to Richard Stollmeyer, and Institutional Venture Partners XIII, L.P. (the ""Signing Stockholders"") caused a transfer of voting control of the Signing Stockholders' Class B common stock, which in turn caused the Signing Stockholders' shares of Class B common stock to be automatically converted into shares of Class A common stock entitled to one vote for each such share of Class A common stock, as opposed to ten votes for each share of Class B common stock. If, as alleged in the Ryan Complaint, the Class B common stock held by the Signing Stockholders were converted into shares of Class A common stock, then, as of the Record Date: (i) there would have been 47,763,583 shares of Class A common stock and 252,950 shares of Class B common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, (ii) 25,146,542 votes would constitute a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY common stock required to adopt the Merger Agreement and the holders of such majority of the voting power would constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting, (iii) the Signing Stockholders would have held, in the aggregate, approximately 6.33% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY's common stock (and approximately 8.43% when taking into account MINDBODY options and RSUs held, in the aggregate, by the Signing Stockholders), and (iv) our directors and executive officers would have held, in the aggregate, approximately 1.33% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY's common stock (and approximately 9.33% when taking into account MINDBODY options and RSUs held, in the aggregate, by our directors and executive officers). The Company vigorously disputes the allegations in the Ryan Complaint and the claim that the Signing Stockholders' shares of Class B common stock were converted into Class A common stock, and believes that the numbers and percentages as of the Record Date are as set forth in the Proxy Statement. However, even if the Class B common stock were converted into Class A common stock as alleged in the Ryan Complaint, the Board of Directors nonetheless encourages stockholders to vote ""FOR"" the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the other proposals set forth in the Proxy Statement.

As previously disclosed in the Company's Schedule 14A, also filed on January 29, 2019, counsel for Luxor Capital Partners, LP, Luxor Wavefront, LP, Lugard Road Capital Master Fund, LP, Luxor Capital Partners Offshore Master Fund, LP, Luxor Capital Partners Offshore, Ltd., Luxor Capital Group, LP, LCG Holdings, LLC, Lugard Road Capital GP, LLC and Luxor Management, LLC (together, ""Luxor"") sent a demand letter (""the Luxor Demand Letter"") to MINDBODY pursuant to Section 220(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (""DGCL"").

After the Company's January 29th filings, on January 30, 2019, Luxor filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of Delaware, captioned Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc., Case No. 2019-0070 (the ""Luxor Complaint""), included below, on January 31, 2019, Hyan Tang, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a putative class action suit in the United States District Court of Delaware, captioned Tang v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00210-UNA (the ""Tang Complaint""), included below; and on February 4, 2019, Sunil Kumar, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a putative class action suit in the United States District Court of the Central District of California, captioned Kumar v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. (the ""Kumar Complaint,"" included below, and together with the Sabatini Complaint, the Schmit Complaint, the Tran Complaint, the Ryan Complaint, the Luxor Complaint and the Tang Complaint, the ""Complaints"").

The following documents in connection with the Luxor Complaint are also included below: Luxor's Motion to Expedite, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on January 30, 2019, Luxor's Statement of Good Cause, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on January 30, 2019, MINDBODY's Opposition to Luxor's Motion to Expedite, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on February 1, 2019, Luxor's Reply to MINDBODY's Opposition, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on February 4, 2019, and the Order of the Court of Chancery of Delaware, granted on February 4, 2019.

The Company believes the Complaints are without merit, and the Company has vigorously defended and continues to vigorously defend against the Complaints.

While the Company believes that the disclosures set forth in the Proxy Statement comply fully with applicable law, in order to moot plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Complaints, avoid nuisance and possible expense, and provide additional information to the Company's stockholders, the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Supplemental Disclosures""). Nothing in the Supplemental Disclosures shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the Complaints that any additional disclosure was or is required.

Supplemental Disclosures to Proxy Statement

The following supplemental information should be read in conjunction with the Proxy Statement, which should be read in its entirety. All page references are to pages in the Proxy Statement, and terms used below, unless otherwise defined, have the meanings set forth in the Proxy Statement. Underlined text shows text being added to a referenced disclosure in the Proxy Statement and a line through text shows text being deleted from a referenced disclosure in the Proxy Statement.

The disclosure under the heading ""The Merger--Background of the Merger"" is hereby supplemented by adding the underlined disclosure after the first paragraph under that heading on page 26 of the Proxy Statement:

In the first half of August 2018, as part of Qatalyst Partners' customary coverage of software companies, a representative of Qatalyst Partners had a meeting with Mr. Stollmeyer. Following this meeting, Qatalyst Partners reached out to Vista, Party A, and Party B as typical outreach to connect strategic companies, including MINDBODY, to such parties.

Separately, on August 7, 2018, a representative of Vista emailed Mr. Stollmeyer, offering to meet for lunch, which took place on September 4, 2018, and at which Mr. Stollmeyer provided the representative of Vista with a general overview of MINDBODY and its approach to the fitness, beauty and wellness services industries as was typical for Mr. Stollmeyer to present to potential investors.

On September 19, 2018, Mr. Stollmeyer received an invitation from the representative of Vista to attend an annual ""meet and greet"" conference hosted by Vista bringing together hundreds of executives in the technology sector, including from Vista's portfolio companies.

The disclosure under the heading ""The Merger--Background of the Merger"" is hereby supplemented by adding the underlined disclosure in the second paragraph under that heading on page 26 of the Proxy Statement:

- **case name**: Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al.; Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al.
- **case filing date**: 2019-01-28
- **case count**: United States District Court of Central District of California
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al."" with case number 2:19-cv-00638. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the Target Case is not explicitly mentioned. However, there is a mention of a ""Kumar Complaint"" filed in the United States District Court of the Central District of California, which is the same court as the Target Case. Additionally, there is a mention of a ""Tran Complaint"" in the same paragraph as the Kumar Complaint, but it does not provide any details about the case. 

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

Since the Target Case is not explicitly mentioned, I will proceed with caution. However, I found that the Company has made supplemental disclosures in response to lawsuits, as stated in the Filing Excerpts: ""While the Company believes that the disclosures set forth in the Proxy Statement comply fully with applicable law, in order to moot plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Complaints, avoid nuisance and possible expense, and provide additional information to the Company's stockholders, the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Supplemental Disclosures"")."" 

However, it is unclear whether the supplemental disclosure is specifically in response to the Target Case. Therefore, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" due to the lack of explicit mention of the Target Case.

**Step 3-6: Search for Explicit Settlement, Other Agreements, Handle Implied Agreement, and Confirm the Agreement Pertains the Target Case**

Since the Target Case is not explicitly mentioned, I will not proceed with these steps.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Target Case is not explicitly mentioned in the Filing Excerpts. Therefore, I will answer ""No"" for both ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""reached_agreement"".

Here is the JSON object with the final answer:

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Ryan Jr. and Friedman v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al.; Ryan v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al.; Ryan v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019-0061. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the passage, specifically in the section describing the Ryan Complaint.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Supplemental Disclosures"") to moot plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Complaints, avoid nuisance and possible expense, and provide additional information to the Company's stockholders. The Supplemental Disclosures are in response to the Complaints, which include the Ryan Complaint.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Ryan Complaint.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Ryan Complaint.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Ryan Complaint.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I do not need to confirm whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, but I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO EXPEDITE PURSUANT TO 8 DEL. C. ยง 220

Plaintiffs Luxor Capital Partners, LP, Luxor Wavefront, LP, Lugard Road Capital Master Fund, LP, and Luxor Capital Partners Offshore Master Fund, LP (collectively ""Luxor"" or ""Plaintiffs""), by and through their undersigned counsel, hereby move for the entry of an order expediting proceedings in this action. The grounds for this motion are as follows:

BACKGROUND

1. Plaintiffs are the beneficial owners of 13.8% of Mindbody's common stock, worth approximately $136,748,815.92 as of market close on December 21, 2018.

2. On December 24, 2018, Mindbody announced that Mindbody, Torreys Parent LLC (""Parent""), and Torreys Merger Sub, Inc. (""Merger Sub"") had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") pursuant to which Mindbody would merge into Merger Sub, with Mindbody continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Parent (the ""Merger""). Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates of Vista Equity Partners Management LLC (""Vista""). The Company's stockholders will vote on the Merger on February 14, 2019.

3. If the Merger closes, each share of Mindbody common stock will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $36.50 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes (the ""Merger Consideration"").

4. The Merger is the result of an expedited sale process triggered by the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Richard Stollmeyer's, seemingly unauthorized efforts to shop the Company. Given the hasty sale process, it is no wonder that the Merger Consideration significantly undervalues the Company.

5. When Luxor tried to schedule a meeting with the Company and Vista to discuss its concerns about the sale process and the adequacy of the Merger Consideration, Mr. Stollmeyer gave Luxor the run-around and refused to facilitate such a meeting.

6. Left with no other option, on January 18, 2019, Luxor served Mindbody with a sworn demand for books and records (the ""Demand"") pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง 220.

7. The purposes of the Demand are to investigate: (i) whether the members of the Mindbody Board of Directors (the ""Board"") breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Merger; (ii) whether the members of the Board were independent with respect to the Merger and any related matters; (iii) the value of Luxor's shares and the fairness of the Merger; (iv) whether to communicate with Mindbody stockholders in advance of the vote on the Merger; (v) the completeness and accuracy of the Company's disclosures regarding the Merger; and (vi) whether to pursue a pre-closing injunction, appraisal, corrective measures, or a post-closing money damages claim in relation to the Merger.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc."" with case number 2019-0070. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned, and the provided text appears to be a court filing related to this case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since we did not find any supplemental disclosure, we can proceed to search for an explicit settlement. However, we can also stop here and conclude that there is no supplemental disclosure. We will proceed to search for an explicit settlement to answer the second question.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement between the Company and the plaintiffs.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

There is no implied agreement in the provided Filing Excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Not applicable, as we did not find any agreement.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, we can conclude that:

- The Company did not make or plan to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.
- There is no explicit or implied agreement between the Company and the plaintiffs.

The grounds for this motion are as follows:

BACKGROUND

1. Plaintiffs are the beneficial owners of 13.8% of Mindbody's common stock, worth approximately $136,748,815.92 as of market close on December 21, 2018.

2. On December 24, 2018, Mindbody announced that Mindbody, Torreys Parent LLC (""Parent""), and Torreys Merger Sub, Inc. (""Merger Sub"") had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") pursuant to which Mindbody would merge into Merger Sub, with Mindbody continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Parent (the ""Merger""). Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates of Vista Equity Partners Management LLC (""Vista""). The Company's stockholders will vote on the Merger on February 14, 2019.

3. If the Merger closes, each share of Mindbody common stock will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $36.50 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes (the ""Merger Consideration"").

4. The Merger is the result of an expedited sale process triggered by the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Richard Stollmeyer's, seemingly unauthorized efforts to shop the Company. Given the hasty sale process, it is no wonder that the Merger Consideration significantly undervalues the Company.

5. When Luxor tried to schedule a meeting with the Company and Vista to discuss its concerns about the sale process and the adequacy of the Merger Consideration, Mr. Stollmeyer gave Luxor the run-around and refused to facilitate such a meeting.

6. Left with no other option, on January 18, 2019, Luxor served Mindbody with a sworn demand for books and records (the ""Demand"") pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง 220.

7. The purposes of the Demand are to investigate: (i) whether the members of the Mindbody Board of Directors (the ""Board"") breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Merger; (ii) whether the members of the Board were independent with respect to the Merger and any related matters; (iii) the value of Luxor's shares and the fairness of the Merger; (iv) whether to communicate with Mindbody stockholders in advance of the vote on the Merger; (v) the completeness and accuracy of the Company's disclosures regarding the Merger; and (vi) whether to pursue a pre-closing injunction, appraisal, corrective measures, or a post-closing money damages claim in relation to the Merger.

8. The Company waited five business days and then responded to the Demand with a host of objections (the ""Response""). Without conceding anything, it has produced its stockholder list (but not its NOBO list or attendant data), and it has offered to ""provide access to certain information that it has reasonably available.""

9. On January 29, counsel for the Company and Luxor met and conferred to discuss the scope and timing of the Company's production in response to the Demand. Company counsel confirmed that the Company was only willing to produce certain limited stocklist materials--its list of stockholders of record (produced with the Response) and its NOBO list and attendant data--but none of the substantive materials requested in Section B of the Demand.

STATEMENT OF GOOD CAUSE

I am a partner at Abrams & Bayliss LLP and a member in good standing of the Bar of the State of Delaware. With my firm, I am counsel to plaintiffs Luxor Capital Partners, LP, Luxor Wavefront, LP, Lugard Road Capital Master Fund, LP, and Luxor Capital Partners Offshore Master Fund, LP (collectively ""Plaintiffs""). We respectfully submit that this action is inappropriate for submission to a Master in the first instance, as it involves a request for expedited consideration of a books and records demand in advance of a stockholder vote scheduled for February 14, 2019 or, in the alternative, in February or March 2019 so that the information requested can be reviewed by Plaintiffs in advance of the deadline to withdraw any appraisal demands (likely to be in mid-April). Therefore, the process of taking and briefing exceptions pursuant to Court of Chancery Rule 144 would unnecessarily delay consideration of this matter.

DEFENDANT'S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF'S

MOTION TO EXPEDITE PURSUANT TO 8 DEL. C. ยง 220

The Complaint for Inspection of Books and Records Pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง 220 filed by Plaintiffs Luxor Capital Partners, LP, Luxor Wavefront, LP, Lugard Road Capital Master Fund, LP, and Luxor Capital Partners Offshore Master Fund, LP (collectively, ""Luxor"") is filled with innuendo and speculation, and represents just one prong of Luxor's coordinated and premeditated campaign to disrupt--for its sole benefit--the merger between MINDBODY, Inc. (""MINDBODY"") and affiliates of Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC (""Vista""). Luxor's motion to expedite a hearing on its Section 220 complaint should be denied for four reasons:

First, Luxor lacks a colorable claim under Section 220. Not only was Luxor's demand grossly overbroad and lacking in any proper purpose, Luxor failed to comply with the requirements of Section 220 by (i) neglecting to submit its demand ""under oath"" and (ii) neglecting to provide sufficient evidence establishing stockholder status. As Luxor has not properly invoked the statute, the Court should not grant Luxor the privilege of expediting its claims.

Second, Luxor's strategic delay in invoking Section 220 belies the existence of any true emergency. Since MINDBODY announced the merger in December, Luxor (along with the world) has been fully aware of the deal price: $36.50 in cash per share of MINDBODY common stock--a 68% premium over the trading price on the day before announcement. Yet Luxor waited nearly three weeks before articulating its purported concerns about the adequacy of that substantial premium, and Luxor chose to do so by filing a Schedule 13D with the SEC (which its Section 220 complaint and motion fail to mention). Only after Luxor's 13D failed to attract support did Luxor attempt to deploy Section 220. Thus, it was not until nearly four weeks after the merger's announcement that Luxor sent MINDBODY a books-and-records demand. And it was not until January 30, 2019, close to five weeks after the announcement, that Luxor filed this action. Luxor now abruptly seeks a trial ""no later than February 8."" Pls. Br. ยถ 23. But there is no urgency requiring a Section 220 trial to be held in less than 4 days after the hearing on the motion to expedite--and Luxor has not pointed to any precedent where this Court has ordered a trial on such short notice. Doing so would inconvenience the Court as well as MINDBODY, while advancing no legitimate goal.

The provided filing excerpts mention the case ""Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v.

STATEMENT OF GOOD CAUSE

I am a partner at Abrams & Bayliss LLP and a member in good standing of the Bar of the State of Delaware. With my firm, I am counsel to plaintiffs Luxor Capital Partners, LP, Luxor Wavefront, LP, Lugard Road Capital Master Fund, LP, and Luxor Capital Partners Offshore Master Fund, LP (collectively ""Plaintiffs""). We respectfully submit that this action is inappropriate for submission to a Master in the first instance, as it involves a request for expedited consideration of a books and records demand in advance of a stockholder vote scheduled for February 14, 2019 or, in the alternative, in February or March 2019 so that the information requested can be reviewed by Plaintiffs in advance of the deadline to withdraw any appraisal demands (likely to be in mid-April). Therefore, the process of taking and briefing exceptions pursuant to Court of Chancery Rule 144 would unnecessarily delay consideration of this matter.

DEFENDANT'S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF'S

MOTION TO EXPEDITE PURSUANT TO 8 DEL. C. ยง 220

The Complaint for Inspection of Books and Records Pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง 220 filed by Plaintiffs Luxor Capital Partners, LP, Luxor Wavefront, LP, Lugard Road Capital Master Fund, LP, and Luxor Capital Partners Offshore Master Fund, LP (collectively, ""Luxor"") is filled with innuendo and speculation, and represents just one prong of Luxor's coordinated and premeditated campaign to disrupt--for its sole benefit--the merger between MINDBODY, Inc. (""MINDBODY"") and affiliates of Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC (""Vista""). Luxor's motion to expedite a hearing on its Section 220 complaint should be denied for four reasons:

First, Luxor lacks a colorable claim under Section 220. Not only was Luxor's demand grossly overbroad and lacking in any proper purpose, Luxor failed to comply with the requirements of Section 220 by (i) neglecting to submit its demand ""under oath"" and (ii) neglecting to provide sufficient evidence establishing stockholder status. As Luxor has not properly invoked the statute, the Court should not grant Luxor the privilege of expediting its claims.

Second, Luxor's strategic delay in invoking Section 220 belies the existence of any true emergency. Since MINDBODY announced the merger in December, Luxor (along with the world) has been fully aware of the deal price: $36.50 in cash per share of MINDBODY common stock--a 68% premium over the trading price on the day before announcement. Yet Luxor waited nearly three weeks before articulating its purported concerns about the adequacy of that substantial premium, and Luxor chose to do so by filing a Schedule 13D with the SEC (which its Section 220 complaint and motion fail to mention). Only after Luxor's 13D failed to attract support did Luxor attempt to deploy Section 220. Thus, it was not until nearly four weeks after the merger's announcement that Luxor sent MINDBODY a books-and-records demand. And it was not until January 30, 2019, close to five weeks after the announcement, that Luxor filed this action. Luxor now abruptly seeks a trial ""no later than February 8."" Pls. Br. ยถ 23. But there is no urgency requiring a Section 220 trial to be held in less than 4 days after the hearing on the motion to expedite--and Luxor has not pointed to any precedent where this Court has ordered a trial on such short notice. Doing so would inconvenience the Court as well as MINDBODY, while advancing no legitimate goal.

Third, Luxor will not suffer any injury, much less irreparably so, without an expedited trial. MINDBODY has already provided Luxor a list of MINDBODY stockholders as of the merger record date, and offered to direct its proxy solicitor to share other available stocklist information (Luxor did not respond). Given MINDBODY's willingness to produce those core stocklist materials to Luxor, expedition is unnecessary. Any remaining dispute can be resolved on a typical Section 220 schedule. See FrontFour Capital Grp. LLC, et al. v. Medley Capital Corp., C.A. No. 2019-0021-KSJM, at 27-29 (Del. Ch. Jan. 16, 2019) (TRANSCRIPT) (prioritizing production of stocklist materials). And, because Luxor's concerns can be addressed adequately after the merger closes (if ever), there is no reason for a trial before the stockholder vote on February 14. Indeed, Luxor implicitly confirms this by requesting, in the alternative, that the Court set a trial as late as March 2019.

Finally, the equities weigh against expedition because Luxor is improperly attempting to use Section 220 to circumvent Rule 34. See Polygon Glob. Opportunities Master Fund v. West Corp., 2006 WL 2947486, at *5 (Del. Ch. Oct. 12, 2006) (""Section 220 is not intended to supplant or circumvent discovery proceedings.""). Luxor is secretly coordinating with one of the named plaintiffs in a separate action related to the merger, Ryan Jr. and Friedman v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al., C.A. No. 2019-0061-VCL (the ""Ryan/Friedman Action""), filed in this Court on January 29, 2019, which alleges breaches of fiduciary duty by MINDBODY's directors. In particular, on information and belief, Luxor principal Douglas Friedman is an immediate family member of Donald Friedman, a named plaintiff in the Ryan/Friedman Action. On information and belief, the Friedmans have coordinated these actions without disclosing their relationship to MINDBODY or this Court. Luxor's shadow participation in the Ryan/Friedman Action--where the breach of fiduciary duty claims that Luxor purports to be interested in investigating have already been asserted--undermines its claimed need for expedited proceedings here. It also indicates that this action is little more than a fishing expedition designed to bolster the Ryan/Friedman Action.

The provided filing excerpts discuss the case ""Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc."" with case number 2019-0070, which matches the target case. Therefore, we can confirm that the filing excerpts are related to the target case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

After reviewing the filing excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since we did not find any supplemental disclosure, we can proceed to search for an explicit settlement. However, after reviewing the filing excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Not applicable since we did not find any agreement.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the defendant company did not make any supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit, and there is no indication of a settlement or agreement.

DEFENDANT'S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF'S

MOTION TO EXPEDITE PURSUANT TO 8 DEL. C. ยง 220

The Complaint for Inspection of Books and Records Pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง 220 filed by Plaintiffs Luxor Capital Partners, LP, Luxor Wavefront, LP, Lugard Road Capital Master Fund, LP, and Luxor Capital Partners Offshore Master Fund, LP (collectively, ""Luxor"") is filled with innuendo and speculation, and represents just one prong of Luxor's coordinated and premeditated campaign to disrupt--for its sole benefit--the merger between MINDBODY, Inc. (""MINDBODY"") and affiliates of Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC (""Vista""). Luxor's motion to expedite a hearing on its Section 220 complaint should be denied for four reasons:

First, Luxor lacks a colorable claim under Section 220. Not only was Luxor's demand grossly overbroad and lacking in any proper purpose, Luxor failed to comply with the requirements of Section 220 by (i) neglecting to submit its demand ""under oath"" and (ii) neglecting to provide sufficient evidence establishing stockholder status. As Luxor has not properly invoked the statute, the Court should not grant Luxor the privilege of expediting its claims.

Second, Luxor's strategic delay in invoking Section 220 belies the existence of any true emergency. Since MINDBODY announced the merger in December, Luxor (along with the world) has been fully aware of the deal price: $36.50 in cash per share of MINDBODY common stock--a 68% premium over the trading price on the day before announcement. Yet Luxor waited nearly three weeks before articulating its purported concerns about the adequacy of that substantial premium, and Luxor chose to do so by filing a Schedule 13D with the SEC (which its Section 220 complaint and motion fail to mention). Only after Luxor's 13D failed to attract support did Luxor attempt to deploy Section 220. Thus, it was not until nearly four weeks after the merger's announcement that Luxor sent MINDBODY a books-and-records demand. And it was not until January 30, 2019, close to five weeks after the announcement, that Luxor filed this action. Luxor now abruptly seeks a trial ""no later than February 8."" Pls. Br. ยถ 23. But there is no urgency requiring a Section 220 trial to be held in less than 4 days after the hearing on the motion to expedite--and Luxor has not pointed to any precedent where this Court has ordered a trial on such short notice. Doing so would inconvenience the Court as well as MINDBODY, while advancing no legitimate goal.

Third, Luxor will not suffer any injury, much less irreparably so, without an expedited trial. MINDBODY has already provided Luxor a list of MINDBODY stockholders as of the merger record date, and offered to direct its proxy solicitor to share other available stocklist information (Luxor did not respond). Given MINDBODY's willingness to produce those core stocklist materials to Luxor, expedition is unnecessary. Any remaining dispute can be resolved on a typical Section 220 schedule. See FrontFour Capital Grp. LLC, et al. v. Medley Capital Corp., C.A. No. 2019-0021-KSJM, at 27-29 (Del. Ch. Jan. 16, 2019) (TRANSCRIPT) (prioritizing production of stocklist materials). And, because Luxor's concerns can be addressed adequately after the merger closes (if ever), there is no reason for a trial before the stockholder vote on February 14. Indeed, Luxor implicitly confirms this by requesting, in the alternative, that the Court set a trial as late as March 2019.

Finally, the equities weigh against expedition because Luxor is improperly attempting to use Section 220 to circumvent Rule 34. See Polygon Glob. Opportunities Master Fund v. West Corp., 2006 WL 2947486, at *5 (Del. Ch. Oct. 12, 2006) (""Section 220 is not intended to supplant or circumvent discovery proceedings.""). Luxor is secretly coordinating with one of the named plaintiffs in a separate action related to the merger, Ryan Jr. and Friedman v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al., C.A. No. 2019-0061-VCL (the ""Ryan/Friedman Action""), filed in this Court on January 29, 2019, which alleges breaches of fiduciary duty by MINDBODY's directors. In particular, on information and belief, Luxor principal Douglas Friedman is an immediate family member of Donald Friedman, a named plaintiff in the Ryan/Friedman Action. On information and belief, the Friedmans have coordinated these actions without disclosing their relationship to MINDBODY or this Court. Luxor's shadow participation in the Ryan/Friedman Action--where the breach of fiduciary duty claims that Luxor purports to be interested in investigating have already been asserted--undermines its claimed need for expedited proceedings here. It also indicates that this action is little more than a fishing expedition designed to bolster the Ryan/Friedman Action.

Luxor's motion to expedite should be denied.

BACKGROUND

A. | Vista Agrees to Acquire MINDBODY and MINDBODY Plans a Go-Shop.

On December 24, 2018, MINDBODY and Vista announced a merger agreement at $36.50 per share, 68% above the closing price of MINDBODY's common stock on the trading day before the merger was announced and 42% above the 30-day volume weighted average price. Compl. ยถ 2. This represents the second-highest revenue multiple ever paid by a private equity firm for a public software-as-a-service company and the third highest multiple for any public software asset. See Compl. Ex. B at 1-2. The merger is subject to approval by MINDBODY shareholders, regulatory review, and other closing conditions. MINDBODY's Board of Directors, who collectively own tens of thousands of shares of MINDBODY common stock and are thus aligned with the interests of MINDBODY'S stockholders, unanimously approved the transaction. See Compl. Ex. B. at 2. The merger agreement provided a 30-day go-shop period. Compl. ยถ 45.

B. | Luxor Publicly Criticizes the Merger in a Detailed Schedule 13D Filing.

On January 9, 2019, MINDBODY filed a preliminary proxy statement disclosing the process leading to the agreement with Vista. Compl. ยถ 77. The next day, Luxor filed a Schedule 13D with the SEC. Ex. 1, Luxor Schedule 13D (Jan. 10, 2019). After declaring the size of its MINDBODY investments--$140 million in common stock and $130 million in convertible notes--Luxor proclaimed that it ""believe[d] that the Proposed Merger significantly undervalue[d] the Shares"" and that it intended to discuss the merger with MINDBODY's stockholders, board of directors, and management.1 Id.

</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc."" with case number 2019-0070. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the text. The case is referenced as ""Luxor's motion to expedite a hearing on its Section 220 complaint"" and ""Luxor's Section 220 complaint and motion fail to mention"" in the DEFENDANT'S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO EXPEDITE PURSUANT TO 8 DEL. C. ยง 220. Therefore, I can confirm that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. However, I found that ""MINDBODY has already provided Luxor a list of MINDBODY stockholders as of the merger record date, and offered to direct its proxy solicitor to share other available stocklist information (Luxor did not respond)."" This statement suggests that MINDBODY has provided some information to Luxor, but it is not clear if this is a supplemental disclosure or amendment. Therefore, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""Settlement Agreement"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement or settlement, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",

PLAINTIFFS' REPLY IN FURTHER

SUPPORT OF THEIR MOTION TO EXPEDITE

1. In its opposition, Mindbody1 contends that the Demand violates Section 220's form and manner requirements, attacks Luxor for waiting four weeks after the Merger announcement to demand books and records, complains of the burden associated with a prompt trial, urges that Luxor's concerns can be addressed post-closing, and alleges that Luxor is colluding with the plaintiffs in a plenary action. All of these arguments fail.

1 | Undefined capitalized terms have the meanings ascribed to them in Luxor's Verified Complaint (the ""Complaint"") (Dkt. 1). All exhibits references are to exhibits to the Complaint.

2. First, the Demand complies with Section 220's form and manner requirements. Moreover, Mindbody raised its form and manner objections for the first time in the opposition and thereby waived them.

3. Second, Mindbody cannot blame Luxor for the time crunch. Luxor acted diligently and sought relief within the time constraints imposed by Mindbody's breakneck transaction schedule.

4. Third, Mindbody's claim that post-closing relief is available ignores the reality that defendants in any post-closing fiduciary duty suit will argue that Luxor should have sought pre-closing relief and that it lacks standing to pursue certain claims post-closing. By refusing to produce even the most basic information, Mindbody is preventing Luxor from complying with the Delaware Supreme Court's directive to use tools at hand to conduct pre-suit investigations.

5. Fourth, Mindbody's objection to the Demand's scope is unavailing. Mindbody refused to negotiate the scope of any substantive production. It cannot now claim that overbreadth defeats expedition.

6. The Court should set a trial for as soon as possible.

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement that indicates a resolution.

Not applicable since no agreement was found.

COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

Plaintiff, by his undersigned attorneys, for this complaint against defendants, alleges upon personal knowledge with respect to himself, and upon information and belief based upon, inter alia, the investigation of counsel as to all other allegations herein, as follows:

NATURE OF THE ACTION

1. This action stems from a proposed transaction announced on December 24, 2018 (the ""Proposed Transaction""), pursuant to which MINDBODY, Inc. (""MINDBODY"" or the ""Company"") will be acquired by affiliates of Vista Equity Partners.

</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc."" with case number 2019-0070. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the document, specifically in the court ruling and the complaint for violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Therefore, I can confirm that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any mention of other agreements related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any implied agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, I do not need to confirm whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I can conclude that the Company did not make or plan to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit, and there is no explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

X1Q6O2F1GPO2,"Tang v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al.",2019-01-31,1:19-cv-00210,UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE; United States District Court of Delaware,000119312519029869_d625421ddefa14a.htm_chunk_45,"<filing_excerpts>
The Ryan Complaint alleges, among other things, that the irrevocable proxies granted by Richard Stollmeyer, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company Board, certain parties related to Richard Stollmeyer, and Institutional Venture Partners XIII, L.P. (the ""Signing Stockholders"") caused a transfer of voting control of the Signing Stockholders' Class B common stock, which in turn caused the Signing Stockholders' shares of Class B common stock to be automatically converted into shares of Class A common stock entitled to one vote for each such share of Class A common stock, as opposed to ten votes for each share of Class B common stock. If, as alleged in the Ryan Complaint, the Class B common stock held by the Signing Stockholders were converted into shares of Class A common stock, then, as of the Record Date: (i) there would have been 47,763,583 shares of Class A common stock and 252,950 shares of Class B common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, (ii) 25,146,542 votes would constitute a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY common stock required to adopt the Merger Agreement and the holders of such majority of the voting power would constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting, (iii) the Signing Stockholders would have held, in the aggregate, approximately 6.33% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY's common stock (and approximately 8.43% when taking into account MINDBODY options and RSUs held, in the aggregate, by the Signing Stockholders), and (iv) our directors and executive officers would have held, in the aggregate, approximately 1.33% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY's common stock (and approximately 9.33% when taking into account MINDBODY options and RSUs held, in the aggregate, by our directors and executive officers). The Company vigorously disputes the allegations in the Ryan Complaint and the claim that the Signing Stockholders' shares of Class B common stock were converted into Class A common stock, and believes that the numbers and percentages as of the Record Date are as set forth in the Proxy Statement. However, even if the Class B common stock were converted into Class A common stock as alleged in the Ryan Complaint, the Board of Directors nonetheless encourages stockholders to vote ""FOR"" the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the other proposals set forth in the Proxy Statement.

As previously disclosed in the Company's Schedule 14A, also filed on January 29, 2019, counsel for Luxor Capital Partners, LP, Luxor Wavefront, LP, Lugard Road Capital Master Fund, LP, Luxor Capital Partners Offshore Master Fund, LP, Luxor Capital Partners Offshore, Ltd., Luxor Capital Group, LP, LCG Holdings, LLC, Lugard Road Capital GP, LLC and Luxor Management, LLC (together, ""Luxor"") sent a demand letter (""the Luxor Demand Letter"") to MINDBODY pursuant to Section 220(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (""DGCL"").

After the Company's January 29th filings, on January 30, 2019, Luxor filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of Delaware, captioned Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc., Case No. 2019-0070 (the ""Luxor Complaint""), included below, on January 31, 2019, Hyan Tang, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a putative class action suit in the United States District Court of Delaware, captioned Tang v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00210-UNA (the ""Tang Complaint""), included below; and on February 4, 2019, Sunil Kumar, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a putative class action suit in the United States District Court of the Central District of California, captioned Kumar v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. (the ""Kumar Complaint,"" included below, and together with the Sabatini Complaint, the Schmit Complaint, the Tran Complaint, the Ryan Complaint, the Luxor Complaint and the Tang Complaint, the ""Complaints"").

The following documents in connection with the Luxor Complaint are also included below: Luxor's Motion to Expedite, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on January 30, 2019, Luxor's Statement of Good Cause, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on January 30, 2019, MINDBODY's Opposition to Luxor's Motion to Expedite, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on February 1, 2019, Luxor's Reply to MINDBODY's Opposition, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on February 4, 2019, and the Order of the Court of Chancery of Delaware, granted on February 4, 2019.

The Company believes the Complaints are without merit, and the Company has vigorously defended and continues to vigorously defend against the Complaints.

While the Company believes that the disclosures set forth in the Proxy Statement comply fully with applicable law, in order to moot plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Complaints, avoid nuisance and possible expense, and provide additional information to the Company's stockholders, the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Supplemental Disclosures""). Nothing in the Supplemental Disclosures shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the Complaints that any additional disclosure was or is required.

Supplemental Disclosures to Proxy Statement

The following supplemental information should be read in conjunction with the Proxy Statement, which should be read in its entirety. All page references are to pages in the Proxy Statement, and terms used below, unless otherwise defined, have the meanings set forth in the Proxy Statement. Underlined text shows text being added to a referenced disclosure in the Proxy Statement and a line through text shows text being deleted from a referenced disclosure in the Proxy Statement.

The disclosure under the heading ""The Merger--Background of the Merger"" is hereby supplemented by adding the underlined disclosure after the first paragraph under that heading on page 26 of the Proxy Statement:

In the first half of August 2018, as part of Qatalyst Partners' customary coverage of software companies, a representative of Qatalyst Partners had a meeting with Mr. Stollmeyer. Following this meeting, Qatalyst Partners reached out to Vista, Party A, and Party B as typical outreach to connect strategic companies, including MINDBODY, to such parties.

Separately, on August 7, 2018, a representative of Vista emailed Mr. Stollmeyer, offering to meet for lunch, which took place on September 4, 2018, and at which Mr. Stollmeyer provided the representative of Vista with a general overview of MINDBODY and its approach to the fitness, beauty and wellness services industries as was typical for Mr. Stollmeyer to present to potential investors.

On September 19, 2018, Mr. Stollmeyer received an invitation from the representative of Vista to attend an annual ""meet and greet"" conference hosted by Vista bringing together hundreds of executives in the technology sector, including from Vista's portfolio companies.

The disclosure under the heading ""The Merger--Background of the Merger"" is hereby supplemented by adding the underlined disclosure in the second paragraph under that heading on page 26 of the Proxy Statement:

- **case filing date**: 2019-01-31
- **case count**: UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE; United States District Court of Delaware
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Tang v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00210. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following sentence:

""...on January 31, 2019, Hyan Tang, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a putative class action suit in the United States District Court of Delaware, captioned Tang v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00210-UNA (the ""Tang Complaint""),...""

This confirms that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following sentence:

""While the Company believes that the disclosures set forth in the Proxy Statement comply fully with applicable law, in order to moot plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Complaints, avoid nuisance and possible expense, and provide additional information to the Company's stockholders, the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Supplemental Disclosures"").""

This indicates that the Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuits, including the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuits, including the Target Case. However, I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case.

Plaintiff Sunil Kumar (""Plaintiff""), by his undersigned attorneys, for his complaint against defendants, alleges upon personal knowledge with respect to himself, and upon information and belief based upon, inter alia, the investigation of counsel as to all other allegations herein, as follows:

NATURE OF THE ACTION

1. This is a class action brought on behalf of the public stockholders of MINDBODY, Inc. (""MINDBODY"" or the ""Company"") against MINDBODY and its Board of Directors (the ""Board"" or the ""Individual Defendants"") for their violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act""), 15 U.S.C. ยงยง 78n(a), 78t(a), and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") Rule 14a-9, 17 C.F.R. 240.14a-9, and to enjoin the vote on a proposed transaction, pursuant to which MINDBODY will be acquired by affiliates of Vista Equity Partners through Torreys Parent, LLC (""Parent"") and Parent's wholly owned subsidiary Torreys Merger Sub, Inc. (""Merger Sub"" and together with Parent and the affiliates of Vista Equity Partners, ""Vista"") (the ""Proposed Transaction"").

2. On December 24, 2018, MINDBODY issued a press release announcing it had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") to sell MINDBODY to Vista for $36.50 in cash for each share of MINDBODY common stock held (the ""Merger Consideration""). The Proposed Transaction is valued at approximately $1.9 billion.

3. On January 23, 2019, MINDBODY filed a Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A (the ""Proxy Statement"") with the SEC. The Proxy Statement, which recommends that MINDBODY stockholders vote in favor of the Proposed Transaction, omits or misrepresents material information concerning, among other things: (i) MINDBODY insiders' potential conflicts of interest and the background process leading to the Proposed Transaction; and (ii) the data and inputs underlying the financial valuation analyses that support the fairness opinion provided by the Company's financial advisor, Qatalyst Partners LP (""Qatalyst"").

Plaintiff Sunil Kumar (""Plaintiff""), by his undersigned attorneys, for his complaint against defendants, alleges upon personal knowledge with respect to himself, and upon information and belief based upon, inter alia, the investigation of counsel as to all other allegations herein, as follows:

NATURE OF THE ACTION

1. This is a class action brought on behalf of the public stockholders of MINDBODY, Inc. (""MINDBODY"" or the ""Company"") against MINDBODY and its Board of Directors (the ""Board"" or the ""Individual Defendants"") for their violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act""), 15 U.S.C. ยงยง 78n(a), 78t(a), and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") Rule 14a-9, 17 C.F.R. 240.14a-9, and to enjoin the vote on a proposed transaction, pursuant to which MINDBODY will be acquired by affiliates of Vista Equity Partners through Torreys Parent, LLC (""Parent"") and Parent's wholly owned subsidiary Torreys Merger Sub, Inc. (""Merger Sub"" and together with Parent and the affiliates of Vista Equity Partners, ""Vista"") (the ""Proposed Transaction"").

2. On December 24, 2018, MINDBODY issued a press release announcing it had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") to sell MINDBODY to Vista for $36.50 in cash for each share of MINDBODY common stock held (the ""Merger Consideration""). The Proposed Transaction is valued at approximately $1.9 billion.

3. On January 23, 2019, MINDBODY filed a Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A (the ""Proxy Statement"") with the SEC. The Proxy Statement, which recommends that MINDBODY stockholders vote in favor of the Proposed Transaction, omits or misrepresents material information concerning, among other things: (i) MINDBODY insiders' potential conflicts of interest and the background process leading to the Proposed Transaction; and (ii) the data and inputs underlying the financial valuation analyses that support the fairness opinion provided by the Company's financial advisor, Qatalyst Partners LP (""Qatalyst""). The failure to adequately disclose such material information constitutes a violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") as MINDBODY stockholders need such information in order to cast a fully-informed vote or seek appraisal in connection with the Proposed Transaction.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over all claims asserted herein for violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 78aa, and 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 (federal question jurisdiction).

5. This Court has jurisdiction over defendants because each defendant is either a corporation that conducts business in and maintains operations within this District, or is an individual who has sufficient minimum contacts with this District so as to render the exercise of jurisdiction by this Court permissible under traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.

6. Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391 because Plaintiff's claims arose in this District, where a substantial portion of the conduct took place, where most of the documents are electronically stored, and where the evidence exists. MINDBODY is incorporated in Delaware and is headquartered in this District. Moreover, each of the Individual Defendants, as Company officers or directors, either resides in this District or has extensive contacts within this District.

PARTIES

7. Plaintiff is, and has been continuously throughout all times relevant hereto, the owner of MINDBODY common stock.
