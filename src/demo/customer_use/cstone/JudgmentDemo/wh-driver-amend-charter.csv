The original certificate of incorporation of the Corporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the ""Secretary of State"") on April 7, 2016 (the ""Original Certificate"") under the name Pensare Technology Group, Inc. The first certificate of amendment of the Original Certificate was filed with the Secretary of State on May 16, 2016. The second certificate of amendment of the Original Certificate was filed with the Secretary of State on December 19, 2016, in which the name of the Corporation was changed from Pensare Technology Group, Inc. to Pensare Acquisition Corp. The third certificate of amendment of the Original Certificate was filed with the Secretary of State on May 11, 2017. The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the ""First Amended and Restated Certificate""), was filed on July 27, 2017 which both restates and amends the provisions of the Original Certificate, as amended.

2. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the ""Second Amended and Restated Certificate""), which both restates and amends the provisions of the First Amended and Restated Certificate, was duly adopted in accordance with Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and by the affirmative vote of the Corporation's stockholders in accordance with Section 228 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the ""DGCL"").

3. The text of the First Amended and Restated Certificate is hereby restated and amended in its entirety to read as follows:

(a) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each such share on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders on which the stockholders generally are entitled to vote.

(b) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, the holders of the Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and on all other matters properly submitted to a vote of the stockholders, and no holder of any series of Preferred Stock, as such, shall be entitled to any voting powers in respect thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including a Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of the Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any amendment to any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of the Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

Section 5.1 Board Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (""Bylaws""), the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, and the Bylaws.

(b) Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, the Board shall be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I, Class II and Class III. The Board is authorized to assign members of the Board already in office to Class I, Class II or Class III. The term of the initial Class I Directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate; the term of the initial Class II Directors shall expire at the second annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate; and the term of the initial Class III Directors shall expire at the third annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate. At each succeeding annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, beginning with the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term or until the election and qualification of their respective successors in office, subject to their earlier death, resignation or removal. Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, if the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director. The Board is hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or resolutions thereof, to assign members of the Board already in office to the aforesaid classes at the time this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (and therefore such classification) becomes effective in accordance with the DGCL.

Section 5.5 Preferred Stock -_Directors. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article V, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) and such directors shall not be included in any of the classes created pursuant to this Article V unless expressly provided by such terms.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), or by the Bylaws, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and provided further, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any indemnitee by this Section 8.2 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.2 by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Section 8.2, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

The doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any other analogous doctrine, shall not apply with respect to the Corporation or any of its officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, in circumstances where the application of any such doctrine would conflict with any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations they may have as of the date of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or in the future. In addition to the foregoing, the doctrine of corporate opportunity shall not apply to any other corporate opportunity with respect to any of the directors or officers of the Corporation unless such corporate opportunity is offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation and such opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Corporation to pursue.

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The relevant provision is in Article XI, which states that the Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate.

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is not explicitly stated in the excerpt. However, Article XI mentions that the Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate ""in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL"". This suggests that the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment may be specified in the DGCL or elsewhere in the Second Amended and Restated Certificate, but it is not explicitly stated in the provided excerpt.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""NA"" since the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment is not explicitly stated.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""NA"" since the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment is not explicitly stated.

The right of the Corporation to purchase or cause to be purchased Equity Interests pursuant to this Article XII shall not be exclusive of any other rights the Corporation may have or hereafter acquire under any agreement, provision of these Amended and Restated Articles or the Bylaws of the Corporation or otherwise. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article XII, the Corporation, the Unsuitable Person and any of its Affiliates shall have the right to propose that the parties, immediately upon or following the delivery of the Transfer Notice, enter into an agreement or other arrangement (including, without limitation, based on any agreement that may be reached between the applicable Gaming Authority and an Unsuitable Person or its Affiliates in this regard), including, without limitation, a divestiture trust or divestiture plan, which will reduce or terminate an Unsuitable Person's or its Affiliate's ownership or control of all or a portion of its Equity Interests over time and, in the event such an agreement or arrangement is reached, the terms of such agreement or arrangement as agreed by the Corporation, such Unsuitable Person and any Affiliates of such Unsuitable Person (including, without limitation, as to the purchase price at which the Equity Interests can be sold) shall apply and prevail over the terms of this Article XII.

""Third Party Transferees"" means one or more third parties determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 1(a) of Article XII of these Amended and Restated Articles to purchase some or all of the Equity Interests to be sold and transferred in accordance with a Transfer Notice and the terms of these Amended and Restated Articles.

""Transfer Date"" means the date specified in the Transfer Notice as the date on which the Equity Interests owned or controlled by an Unsuitable Person or an Affiliate of an Unsuitable Person (as applicable) are to be sold and transferred to the Corporation or one or more Third Party Transferees in accordance with Article XII of these Amended and Restated Articles, which date shall be no less forty-six (46) days and no later than seventy-five (75) days after the date of the Transfer Notice.

""Transfer Notice"" means a notice of transfer delivered by the Corporation to an Unsuitable Person or an Affiliate of an Unsuitable Person (as applicable) if the Board of Directors deems it necessary or advisable, to cause such Unsuitable Person's or Affiliate's (as applicable) Equity Interests to be sold and transferred pursuant to Article XII of these Amended and Restated Articles. Each Transfer Notice shall set forth (i) the Transfer Date, (ii) the number and class/series of Equity Interests to be sold and transferred, (iii) the Purchase Price with respect to each class/series of such Equity Interests which will be determined in accordance with the terms of Article XII of these Amended and Restated Articles, (iv) the place where any certificates for such Equity Interests shall be surrendered, and (v) any other reasonable requirements of surrender of the Equity Interests imposed in good faith by the Corporation, including, without limitation, how certificates representing such Equity Interests are to be endorsed, if at all.

**Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?**

Yes, there are several provisions that require a vote of stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it. For example, Article V, Section 2 states that ""any alteration, amendment or repeal of Articles V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI or XII shall require the affirmative vote of (a) a majority of the voting power of the Voting Stock while the Corporation is under Founder Control and (b) at least two-thirds of the voting power of the Voting Stock from and after the time that the Corporation ceases to be under Founder Control.""

**Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?**

The percentage of shareholders required for the amendment varies depending on the circumstances. While the Corporation is under Founder Control, a majority of the voting power of the Voting Stock is required. After the Corporation ceases to be under Founder Control, at least two-thirds of the voting power of the Voting Stock is required.

**Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?**

Yes, the required percentage is a supermajority in some cases. Specifically, after the Corporation ceases to be under Founder Control, at least two-thirds of the voting power of the Voting Stock is required, which is a supermajority.

**Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?**

Yes, the supermajority requirement is only applied for a subset of articles. Specifically, the supermajority requirement applies to Articles V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any amendment to any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of the Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled exclusively, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

Section 5.1 Board Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, as it may be further amended from time to time, or the Amended and Restated By-Laws of the Corporation, as they may be further amended from time to time (""By-Laws""), the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL and this Second Amended and Restated Certificate.

Section 5.5 Preferred Stock - Directors. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article V, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation).

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By-Laws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By-Laws. The By-Laws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and except as set forth in Article XI, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By-Laws; and provided further, however, that no By-Laws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such By-Laws had not been adopted.

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any indemnitee by this Section 8.2 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate as it may be further amended from time to time, the By-Laws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.2 by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Section 8.2, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

(a) To the extent allowed by law, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any other analogous doctrine, shall not apply with respect to the Corporation or any of its officers or directors in circumstances where the application of any such doctrine to a corporate opportunity would conflict with any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations they may have as of the date of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or in the future. The Corporation renounces any expectancy that any of the directors or officers of the Corporation will offer any such corporate opportunity of which he or she may become aware to the Corporation, except, the doctrine of corporate opportunity shall apply with respect to any of the directors or officers of the Corporation with respect to a corporate opportunity that was offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation and (i) such opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Corporation to pursue and (ii) the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to the Corporation without violating any legal obligation.

(c) Neither the alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article IX, nor the adoption of any provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) inconsistent with this Article IX, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article IX in respect of any business opportunity first identified or any other matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Article IX, would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration, amendment, addition, repeal or adoption.

Section 7.3 Action by Written Consent. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of stockholders may, except as otherwise required by law, be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of record of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Corporation not less than the minimum number of votes (determined as of the record date of such consent) that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereat were present and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt states in Article XI that ""The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL;"". However, it does not specify the voting requirements for such amendments.

However, in the section ""AMENDMENT OF SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION"", it is stated that ""all rights, preferences and privileges herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article XI."" This implies that the amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation is subject to certain rights and privileges of the stockholders, but it does not explicitly state the voting requirements.

However, in Section 7.3, it is stated that ""Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of stockholders may, except as otherwise required by law, be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of record of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Corporation not less than the minimum number of votes (determined as of the record date of such consent) that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereat were present and voted.""

Therefore, the answer to Q1 is ""Yes"".

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""NA"". The excerpt does not explicitly state the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment. However, it mentions that the consent in writing shall be signed by the holders of record of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Corporation not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereat were present and voted.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""NA"". Since the percentage is not explicitly stated, it is not possible to determine whether it is a supermajority or not.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""NA"". Since the percentage is not explicitly stated, it is not possible to determine whether the supermajority requirement is applied only for a subset of articles or not.

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"" because the excerpt states that ""The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute..."" and also provides specific voting requirements for certain amendments, such as increasing or decreasing the number of authorized shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock.

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""66.67"" because the excerpt states that ""any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of the then issued and outstanding capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.""

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"" because the percentage of 66.67% is indeed a supermajority.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Yes, removal of directors"" because the supermajority requirement of 66.67% only applies to the removal of directors, not to all amendments of the Certificate of Incorporation.

Any adjustment described in this Section 4.3(G) shall become effective at the close of business on the date the combination or subdivision becomes effective.

Section 5.1. By-Laws. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by the DGCL, the Board is expressly authorized to make, amend, alter, change, add to or repeal the by-laws of the Corporation (as the same may be amended from time to time, the ""By-Laws"") without the assent or vote of the stockholders in any manner not inconsistent with the laws of the State of Delaware or this Certificate of Incorporation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote of the stockholders, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required herein (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock), by the By-Laws or pursuant to applicable law, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required in order for the stockholders of the Corporation to alter, amend, repeal or rescind, in whole or in part, any provision of Article I, Article II or Article IV of the By-Laws of the Corporation, or to adopt any provision inconsistent therewith and, with respect to any other provision of the By-Laws of the Corporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required in order for the stockholders of the Corporation to alter, amend, repeal or rescind, in whole or in part, any such provision of the By-Laws of the Corporation, or to adopt any provision inconsistent therewith.

Section 8.1. Limited Liability of Directors. To the fullest extent permitted by law, no director of the Corporation will have any personal liability to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Neither the amendment nor the repeal of this Article VIII shall eliminate, reduce or otherwise adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the Corporation existing prior to such amendment or repeal.

(G) Any alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article X shall require the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. Neither the alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article X, nor the adoption of any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock) inconsistent with this Article X, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article X in respect of any business opportunity first identified or any other matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Article X, would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration, amendment, addition, repeal or adoption. This Article X shall not limit any protections or defenses available to, or indemnification or advancement rights of, any director or officer of the Corporation under this Certificate of Incorporation, the By-Laws or applicable law.

Section 12.1. Forum. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, other employee, agent or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, or any claim for aiding and abetting such alleged breach, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any current or former director, officer, other employee, agent or stockholder of the Corporation (a) arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, this Certificate of Incorporation (as it may be amended or restated) or the By-Laws or (b) as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Delaware Court of Chancery or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any current or former director, officer, other employee, agent or stockholder of the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the law of the State of Delaware shall, as to any action in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), to the fullest extent permitted by law, be solely and exclusively brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to any claim (a) as to which the Delaware Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (b) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Delaware Court of Chancery, or (c) arising under federal securities laws, including the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as to which the federal district courts of the United States of America shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Article XII will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum. If any action the subject matter of which is within the scope of the forum provisions is filed in a court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (a ""foreign action"") in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an ""enforcement action""); and (y) having service of process made upon such stockholder in any such enforcement action by service upon such stockholder's counsel in the foreign action as agent for such stockholder. Failure to enforce the foregoing provisions would cause the Corporation irreparable harm and the Corporation shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, to enforce the foregoing provisions. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article XII.

Section 13.1. Amendments. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, in addition to any vote required by law, the following provisions in this Certificate of Incorporation may be amended, altered, repealed or rescinded, in whole or in part, or any provision inconsistent therewith or herewith may be adopted, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class: Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article IX, Article XII and this Article XIII. Except as expressly provided in the foregoing sentence and the remainder of this Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock), this Certificate of Incorporation may be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt contains several provisions that require a vote of stockholders to amend certain sections of the Certificate of Incorporation.

The answer is ""Yes"" for the 66.67% requirement, and ""No"" for the 50% requirement.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Yes"", the supermajority requirement of 66.67% applies to Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article IX, Article XII, and Article XIII. Additionally, Article X requires a supermajority of 80%.

2 | This Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which restates, integrates and further amends the certificate of incorporation of the corporation, has been duly adopted by the corporation in accordance with Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and has been adopted by the requisite vote of the stockholders of the corporation in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

3 | The certificate of incorporation of the corporation is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

2 | Voting. Except as otherwise provided by law or by the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of any series of Preferred Stock, the holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election and removal of directors and for all other purposes, and each holder of record of Common Stock, as such, shall have one vote for each share of Common Stock which is outstanding in his, her or its name on the books of the Corporation on all matters on which stockholders are entitled to vote generally. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended from time to time, including the terms of any Preferred Stock Designation (as defined below), this ""Certificate of Incorporation"") to the contrary, the holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

Seventh: To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as it now exists and as it may hereafter be amended, no director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or hereafter may be amended. No repeal or modification of this Article SEVENTH shall apply to or have any adverse effect on any right or protection of, or any limitation of the liability of, a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, and any other provisions authorized by the DGCL may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by law; and all rights, preferences and privileges of whatsoever nature conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons whomsoever by and pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article ELEVENTH. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock required by law, by this Certificate of Incorporation or by any Preferred Stock Designation, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, or to adopt any new provision of this Certificate of Incorporation; provided, however, that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, any of Article FIFTH, Article SEVENTH, Article EIGHTH, Article NINTH, Article TENTH, Article TWELFTH, Article THIRTEENTH, Article FOURTEENTH, Article FIFTEENTH and this sentence of this Certificate of Incorporation, or in each case, the definition of any capitalized terms used therein or any successor provision (including, without limitation, any such article or section as renumbered as a result of any amendment, alteration, change, repeal or adoption of any provision (other than such article or section as renumbered, or this sentence), in each case, of this Certificate of Incorporation).

Twelfth: In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board is expressly authorized and empowered to adopt, amend and repeal the Bylaws by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock required by law, by this Certificate of Incorporation or by any Preferred Stock Designation, the Bylaws may also be amended, altered or repealed and new Bylaws may be adopted by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon.

1 | Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (3) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time), or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article THIRTEENTH.

IN WI'INESS WHEREOF, the undersigned bas executed this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation as of this 29 day of September, 2020.

Fourth: The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock that the Corporation is authorized to issue is 2,275,000,000 shares, consisting of (i) 2,250,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Common Stock""), and (ii) 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""Preferred Stock""). Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, the number of authorized shares of any of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL, and no vote of the holders of any of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock voting separately as a class shall be required therefor.","To answer the questions, I will go through the excerpt and identify the relevant provisions.

Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The excerpt states: ""Notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock required by law, by this Certificate of Incorporation or by any Preferred Stock Designation, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation...""

This indicates that a vote of the stockholders is required to amend the Certificate of Incorporation. Therefore, the answer to Q1 is ""Yes"".

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The excerpt states: ""...the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation...""

This indicates that a majority (50%) of the voting power is required for the amendment. However, there is an additional provision that requires a higher percentage for certain articles: ""...the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, any of Article FIFTH, Article SEVENTH, Article EIGHTH, Article NINTH, Article TENTH, Article TWELFTH, Article THIRTEENTH, Article FOURTEENTH, Article FIFTEENTH...""

Therefore, the answer to Q2 is ""50"" for general amendments, but ""66.67"" for amendments to certain articles.

Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

Since the percentage required for general amendments is 50%, which is not a supermajority, the answer to Q3 is ""No"" for general amendments. However, for amendments to certain articles, the percentage required is 66.67%, which is a supermajority. Therefore, the answer to Q3 is ""Yes"" for amendments to certain articles.

Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The excerpt states: ""...the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, any of Article FIFTH, Article SEVENTH, Article EIGHTH, Article NINTH, Article TENTH, Article TWELFTH, Article THIRTEENTH, Article FOURTEENTH, Article FIFTEENTH...""

This indicates that the supermajority requirement is only applied for a subset of articles, specifically Article FIFTH, Article SEVENTH, Article EIGHTH, Article NINTH, Article TENTH, Article TWELFTH, Article THIRTEENTH, Article FOURTEENTH, and Article FIFTEENTH.

Neither the amendment nor repeal of this Article VII, nor the adoption of any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, nor, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, any modification of law shall eliminate, reduce or otherwise adversely affect any right or protection of a current or former director of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal, adoption or modification.

1 | Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any director or officer or other employee of the Corporation arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (as either may be amended, restated, modified, supplemented or waived from time to time); (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any director or officer or other employee of the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine; or (v) any action asserting an ""internal corporate claim"" as that term is defined in Section 115 of the DGCL, shall be a state court located within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware). For the avoidance of doubt, this Article XI(A)(1) shall not apply to any action or proceeding asserting a claim under the Securities Act of 1933 (the ""Securities Act"") or the Exchange Act.

6 | The number of authorized shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL (or any successor provision thereto), and no vote of the holders of any of the Common Stock or the Preferred Stock voting separately as a class shall be required therefor, unless a vote of any such holder is required pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock).

A. At any time when the Sellers and their Permitted Transferees beneficially own, in the aggregate, 50% or more of the voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the books in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be made by hand, or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. At any time when the Sellers and their Permitted Transferees beneficially own, in the aggregate, less than 50% of the voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of such holders and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such holders; provided, however, that any action required or permitted to be taken by the holders of Preferred Stock, voting separately as a series or separately as a class with one or more other such series, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, to the extent expressly so provided by the applicable certificate of designation relating to such series of Preferred Stock.

A. Except as otherwise provided in this Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL, the business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. Except as otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement or any certificate of designation with respect to any series of Preferred Stock, the total number of directors shall be determined from time to time exclusively by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors; provided that any determination by the Board of Directors to increase or decrease the total number of directors shall require the approval of 66 2/3% of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present. The directors (other than those directors elected by the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, voting separately as a series or together with one or more other such series, as the case may be) shall be divided into three classes designated Class I, Class II and Class III. Each class shall consist, as nearly as possible, of one-third of the total number of such directors. Class I directors shall initially serve for a term expiring immediately following the Company's annual meeting of stockholders for the calendar year ended December 31, 2021, Class II directors shall initially serve for a term expiring immediately following the Company's annual meeting of stockholders for the calendar year ended December 31, 2022 and Class III directors shall initially serve for a term expiring immediately following the Company's annual meeting of stockholders for the calendar year ended December 31, 2023. Commencing with the annual meeting of stockholders for the calendar year ended December 31, 2021, the directors of the class to be elected at each annual meeting shall be elected for a three year term. If the number of such directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any such additional director of any class elected to fill a newly created directorship resulting from an increase in such class shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors remove or shorten the term of any incumbent director. Any such director shall hold office until the annual meeting at which his or her term expires and until his or her successor shall be elected and qualified, or his or her earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office. The Board of Directors is authorized to assign members of the Board of Directors already in office to their respective class.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt states in Article V, Section A: ""the following provisions in this Certificate of Incorporation may be amended, altered, repealed or rescinded, in whole or in part, or any provision inconsistent therewith or herewith may be adopted, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class: this Article V, Article VI, Article IX.""

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""66.67"". The excerpt states that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation is required.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". The required percentage of 66.67% is indeed a supermajority.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Yes, Articles V, VI, IX"". The excerpt specifically states that the supermajority requirement applies to amendments, alterations, repeals, or rescissions of Articles V, VI, and IX.

This Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the ""Amended and Restated Certificate""), which both restates and amends the provisions of the Original Certificate, was duly adopted in accordance with Sections 228, 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended from time to time (the ""DGCL"").

3. The text of the Original Certificate is hereby restated and amended in its entirety to read as follows:

(ii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each such share on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders of the Corporation on which the holders of the shares of Common Stock are entitled to vote.

(iii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, the holders of the shares of Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and on all other matters properly submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law or this Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of the shares of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate (including any amendment to any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series of Preferred Stock are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

Section 5.1 Board Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (""Bylaws""), the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL, this Amended and Restated Certificate, and any Bylaws adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation; provided, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

Section 5.5 Preferred Stock - Directors. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article V, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation).

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of directors present at a regular or special meeting of the Board at which there is a quorum or by unanimous written consent. The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders of the Corporation; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders of the Corporation to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and provided further, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any indemnitee by this Section 8.2 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.2 by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Section 8.2, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

The Corporation renounces, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any interest or expectancy of the Corporation in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any Excluded Opportunity pursuant to Section 122(17) of the DGCL. An ""Excluded Opportunity"" is any matter, transaction or interest that is presented to, or acquired, created or developed by, or which otherwise comes into the possession of (a) any director of the Corporation who is not an employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, or (b) any holder of Common Stock or Preferred Stock or any partner, member, director, stockholder, employee or agent of any such holder, other than someone who is an employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries (collectively, ""Covered Persons""), unless such matter, transaction or interest is presented to, or acquired, created or developed by, or otherwise comes into the possession of, a Covered Person expressly and solely in such Covered Person's capacity as a director of the Corporation, such opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Corporation to pursue, and to the extent the director is permitted to refer that opportunity to the Corporation without violating any legal or contractual obligation. Any amendment, repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article IX shall not adversely affect any right or protection of any director, officer or other agent of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or modification.

AMENDMENT OF AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force that may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL; and, except as set forth in Article VIII, all rights, preferences and privileges of whatever nature herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article X.

Section 11.1 Forum. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, and except as otherwise set forth in the immediately following sentence, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a beneficial owner) to bring (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (c) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws, or (d) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (a) through (d) above, any claim as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the provisions of this Section 11.1 will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction and (b) unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action against the Corporation or any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation and arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

If any provision or provisions (or any part thereof) of this Amended and Restated Certificate shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any person, entity or circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of such provisions in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Amended and Restated Certificate containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) and the application of such provision to other persons or entities and circumstances shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (b) the provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Amended and Restated Certificate containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to permit the Corporation to protect its directors, officers, employees and agents from personal liability in respect of their good faith service or for the benefit of the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by law.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Monocle Holdings Inc. has caused this Amended and Restated Certificate to be duly executed and acknowledged in its name and on its behalf by an authorized officer as of the date first set forth above.

[Signature Page to Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation]","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The relevant provision is in Article X, which states: ""The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate..."".

However, the excerpt does not explicitly state the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment. But it does mention that the amendment can be done ""in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL"". This implies that the amendment may require a vote of shareholders, but the specific percentage is not mentioned.

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""NA"", as the excerpt does not explicitly state the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""NA"", as the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment is not mentioned.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""NA"", as the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment is not mentioned, and therefore it is unclear whether a supermajority requirement applies to a subset of articles.

3. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the ""Second Amended and Restated Certificate""), which both restates and amends the provisions of the First Amended and Restated Certificate, was duly adopted in accordance with Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended from time to time (the ""DGCL"").

4. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall become effective on the date of filing with the Secretary of State of Delaware.

5. The text of the First Amended and Restated Certificate is hereby restated and amended in its entirety to read as follows:

(i) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of the shares of Common Stock shall exclusively possess all voting power with respect to the Corporation.

(ii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each such share on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders of the Corporation on which the holders of the Common Stock are entitled to vote.

(iii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, holders of the Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and on all other matters properly submitted to a vote of the stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any amendment to any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series of Preferred Stock are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

Section 5.1 Board Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (""Bylaws""), the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, and any Bylaws adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation; provided, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

(b) Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, the Board shall be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I, Class II and Class III. The Board is authorized to assign members of the Board already in office to Class I, Class II or Class III. The term of the initial Class I Directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate; the term of the initial Class II Directors shall expire at the second annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate; and the term of the initial Class III Directors shall expire at the third annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate. At each succeeding annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, beginning with the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, each of the successors elected to replace the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term or until the election and qualification of their respective successors in office, subject to their earlier death, resignation or removal. Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, if the number of directors that constitute the Board is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board shorten the term of any incumbent director. Subject to the rights of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors pursuant to the terms of one or more series of Preferred Stock, the election of directors shall be determined. Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. The Board is hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or resolutions thereof, to assign members of the Board already in office to the aforesaid classes at the time this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (and therefore such classification) becomes effective in accordance with the DGCL.

Section 5.5 Preferred Stock - Directors. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article V, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) and such directors shall not be included in any of the classes created pursuant to this Article V unless expressly provided by such terms.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of directors present at a regular or special meeting of the Board at which there is a quorum or by unanimous written consent. The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders of the Corporation to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and provided further, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

Section 7.3 Action by Written Consent. Except as may be otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) relating to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected by a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders.

Section 8.1 Limitation of Director Liability. A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. If the DGCL is amended after the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate to authorize the further elimination or limitation of the liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as so amended. Any amendment, modification or repeal of the foregoing sentence shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such amendment, modification or repeal.

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any indemnitee by this Section 8.2 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.2 by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Section 8.2, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

AMENDMENT OF SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force that may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL; and, except as set forth in Article VIII, all rights, preferences and privileges of whatever nature herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article IX.

[Signature Page to Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation]","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The provision is stated in the section ""AMENDMENT OF SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION"" which mentions that the Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate.

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""NA"". The excerpt does not specify the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""NA"". Since the percentage is not specified, it is not possible to determine if it is a supermajority.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""NA"". Since the percentage is not specified, it is not possible to determine if the supermajority requirement is applied to a subset of articles.

Here is the JSON object summarizing the answers:

```

However, upon re-reading the excerpt, I found a provision in Section 5.1 that mentions the Bylaws can be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders with the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. This provision implies that a majority vote is required to amend the Bylaws, but it does not explicitly state the percentage required to amend the Certificate of Incorporation.

Additionally, I found another provision in Section 10.1 that mentions the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, but it does not relate to the amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation.

But then I found another provision in the section ""AMENDMENT OF SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION"" which mentions that the Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force that may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL; 

However, the excerpt does not explicitly state the percentage of shareholders required to amend the Certificate of Incorporation. But it does mention that the amendment can be done in the manner prescribed by the DGCL. 

According to the DGCL, a corporation may amend its certificate of incorporation by obtaining the approval of its stockholders, which typically requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. 

Therefore, I will update my previous answer as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". 

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""50"". 

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""No"". 

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""NA"".

2. Voting. Except as otherwise provided herein or expressly required by law, each holder of Class A Common Stock, as such, shall be entitled to vote on each matter submitted to a vote of stockholders and shall be entitled to one (1) vote for each share of Class A Common Stock held of record by such holder as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter. Except as otherwise required by law, holders of Class A Common Stock, as such, shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Certificate of Designation (as defined below)) that relates solely to the rights, powers, preferences (or the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof) or other terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Certificate of Designation) or pursuant to the DGCL.

Authority is hereby expressly granted to the Board of Directors from time to time to issue the Preferred Stock in one or more series, and in connection with the creation of any such series, by adopting a resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of the shares thereof and by filing a certificate of designation relating thereto in accordance with the DGCL (a ""Certificate of Designation""), to determine and fix the number of shares of such series and such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designations, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, including without limitation thereof, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, and to increase or decrease (but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding) the number of shares of any series as shall be stated and expressed in such resolutions, all to the fullest extent now or hereafter permitted by the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the resolution or resolutions providing for the creation and issuance of any series of Preferred Stock may provide that such series shall be superior or rank equally or be junior to any other series of Preferred Stock to the extent permitted by law and this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Certificate of Designation). Except as otherwise required by law, holders of any series of Preferred Stock shall be entitled only to such voting rights, if any, as shall expressly be granted thereto by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Certificate of Designation).

A. Subject to that certain Stockholders Agreement, dated as of August 26, 2020, by and among Trine Acquisition Corp. (now known as Desktop Metal, Inc.) and Trine Sponsor IH, LLC (as such agreement may be amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the ""Stockholders Agreement"") and the special rights of the holders of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock to elect directors, the directors of the Corporation shall be classified with respect to the time for which they severally hold office into three classes, designated as Class I, Class II and Class III. The initial Class I directors shall serve for a term expiring at the first annual meeting of the stockholders following the date of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate; the initial Class II directors shall serve for a term expiring at the second annual meeting of the stockholders following the date of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate; and the initial Class III directors shall serve for a term expiring at the third annual meeting following the date of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate. At each annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation beginning with the first annual meeting of the stockholders following the date of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, subject to the Stockholders Agreement (as defined below) and the special rights of the holders of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock to elect directors, the successors of the class of directors whose term expires at that meeting shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of the stockholders held in the third year following the year of their election. Each director shall hold office until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation, disqualification or removal. No decrease in the number of directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. Subject to the Stockholders Agreement, the Board of Directors is authorized to assign members of the Board of Directors already in office to Class I, Class II and Class III.

B. Except as otherwise expressly provided by the DGCL or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be fixed exclusively by one or more resolutions adopted from time to time by the Board of Directors.

E. Whenever the holders of any one or more series of Preferred Stock issued by the Corporation shall have the right, voting separately as a series or separately as a class with one or more such other series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, removal and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Certificate of Designation). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article V, the number of directors that may be elected by the holders of any such series of Preferred Stock shall be in addition to the number fixed pursuant to paragraph B of this Article V, and the total number of directors constituting the whole Board of Directors shall be automatically adjusted accordingly. Except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Designation(s) in respect of one or more series of Preferred Stock, whenever the holders of any series of Preferred Stock having such right to elect additional directors are divested of such right pursuant to the provisions of such Certificate of Designation(s), the terms of office of all such additional directors elected by the holders of such series of Preferred Stock, or elected to fill any vacancies resulting from the death, resignation, disqualification or removal of such additional directors, shall forthwith terminate (in which case each such director thereupon shall cease to be qualified as, and shall cease to be, a director) and the total authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall automatically be reduced accordingly.

F. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Corporation (as amended and/or restated from time to time, the ""Bylaws""). In addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation required by applicable law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Certificate of Designation in respect of one or more series of Preferred Stock) or the Bylaws of the Corporation, the adoption, amendment or repeal of the Bylaws of the Corporation by the stockholders of the Corporation shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (66 and 2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of voting stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in an election of directors.

No director of the Corporation shall have any personal liability to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or hereafter may be amended. Any amendment, repeal or modification of this Article VII, or the adoption of any provision of the Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Article VII, shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such amendment, repeal, modification or adoption. If the DGCL is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article VII to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as so amended.

Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, (a) the Court of Chancery (the ""Chancery Court"") of the State of Delaware (or, in the event that the Chancery Court does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state courts of the State of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action, suit or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation or to the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action, suit or proceeding arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or the bylaws of the Corporation or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (as either may be amended from time to time) or (iv) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim against the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine; and (b) subject to the preceding provisions of this Article IX, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. If any action the subject matter of which is within the scope of clause (a) of the immediately preceding sentence is filed in a court other than the courts in the State of Delaware (a ""Foreign Action"") in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the provisions of clause (a) of the immediately preceding sentence and (y) having service of process made upon such stockholder in any such action by service upon such stockholder's counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such stockholder.

A. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate to the contrary, in addition to any vote required by applicable law, the following provisions in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate may be amended, altered, repealed or rescinded, in whole or in part, or any provision inconsistent therewith or herewith may be adopted, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (66 and 2/3%) of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class: Part B of Article IV, Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article IX, and this Article X.

B. If any provision or provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any circumstance for any reason whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality and enforceability of such provisions in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in any way be affected or impaired thereby and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including, without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to permit the Corporation to protect its directors, officers, employees and agents from personal liability in respect of their good faith service to or for the benefit of the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by law.

A. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, and shall not be taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any action required or permitted to be taken by the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, voting separately as a series or separately as a class with one or more other such series, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, to the extent expressly so provided by the applicable Certificate of Designation relating to such series of Preferred Stock, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding shares of the relevant series of Preferred Stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt states in Section 12.01 that the Corporation may amend its Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws by a Resolution of Stockholders or by a resolution adopted by a majority of the Board. Additionally, Section 12.02 states that no amendment may be made to the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws by a Resolution of Stockholders to amend certain articles, such as Article X, unless certain conditions are met.

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""50"" or ""majority"". The excerpt states in Section 12.01 that no amendment may be made by the Board to change the percentage of stockholders required to pass a Resolution of Stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws. Additionally, Section (b) states that in all other cases, a resolution approved at a duly convened and constituted meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes of the shares entitled to vote thereon which were present at the meeting and were voted, or a resolution consented to in writing by holders of a majority of the votes of all the shares entitled to vote thereon.

Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""No"". The excerpt states that a majority of the votes of the shares entitled to vote thereon is required, which is 50%.

Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""NA"". Since the answer to Q3 is ""No"", there is no supermajority requirement.

Voting. Except as otherwise provided herein or expressly required by law, each holder of Common Stock, as such, shall be entitled to vote on each matter submitted to a vote of stockholders and shall be entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held of record by such holder as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter. Except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock, as such, shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation (as defined below)) that relates solely to the rights, powers, preferences (or the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof) or other terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation) or pursuant to the DGCL.

5. Transfer Rights. Subject to applicable law and the transfer restrictions set forth in Article VII of the bylaws of the Corporation (as such Bylaws may be amended from time to time, the ""Bylaws""), shares of Common Stock and the rights and obligations associated therewith shall be fully transferable to any transferee.

No director of the Corporation shall have any personal liability to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or hereafter may be amended. Any amendment, repeal or modification of this Article IX, or the adoption of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation inconsistent with this Article IX, shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such amendment, repeal, modification or adoption. If the DGCL is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article IX to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as so amended.

A. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery (the ""Chancery Court"") of the State of Delaware (or, in the event that the Chancery Court does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state courts of the State of Delaware) and any appellate court thereof shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action, suit or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation or to the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action, suit or proceeding arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or the Bylaws or this Certificate of Incorporation (as either may be amended from time to time), (iv) any action, suit or proceeding as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (v) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim against the Corporation or any current or former director, officer or stockholder governed by the internal affairs doctrine. If any action the subject matter of which is within the scope of the immediately preceding sentence is filed in a court other than the courts in the State of Delaware (a ""Foreign Action"") in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to (a) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence and (b) having service of process made upon such stockholder in any such action by service upon such stockholder's counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such stockholder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Article XII(A) shall not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts of the United States have exclusive jurisdiction.

A. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, in addition to any vote required by applicable law, the following provisions in this Certificate of Incorporation may be amended, altered, repealed or rescinded, in whole or in part, or any provision inconsistent therewith or herewith may be adopted, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class: Article V(B), Article VII, Article VIII, Article IX, Article X, Article XI, Article XII and this Article XIII.

F. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws, subject to the power of the stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote with respect thereto to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws. The stockholders of the Corporation shall also have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws; provided, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation required by applicable law or by this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation in respect of one or more series of Preferred Stock) or the Bylaws of the Corporation, the adoption, amendment or repeal of the Bylaws of the Corporation by the stockholders of the Corporation shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of voting stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in an election of directors.

A. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, and shall not be taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any action required or permitted to be taken by the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, voting separately as a series or separately as a class with one or more other such series, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, to the extent expressly so provided by the applicable Certificate of Designation relating to such series of Preferred Stock, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding shares of the relevant series of Preferred Stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

Subject to the rights of any holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock, the number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL.","To answer the questions, I will go through the excerpt and identify the relevant provisions.

The excerpt contains several articles and sections, but the relevant provisions for the questions are:

* Article XIII(A): This article states that certain provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation may be amended, altered, repealed, or rescinded only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon.
* Article F: This article states that the adoption, amendment, or repeal of the Bylaws of the Corporation by the stockholders of the Corporation shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of voting stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in an election of directors.

Based on these provisions, I will answer the questions as follows:

Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

Answer: Yes

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

Answer: 66.67

Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

Answer: Yes

Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

Answer: Yes, the supermajority requirement applies to Article V(B), Article VII, Article VIII, Article IX, Article X, Article XI, Article XII, and Article XIII.

This Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which restates, integrates and further amends the certificate of incorporation of this corporation as heretofore amended and restated, has been duly adopted by the corporation in accordance with Sections 242 and 245 of the DGCL and has been adopted by the requisite vote of the stockholders of this corporation, acting by written consent in lieu of a meeting in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL.

3. The certificate of incorporation of this corporation is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

1. Equal Status; General. Except as otherwise provided in this Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended and/or restated from time to time, including pursuant to any Preferred Stock Designation (as defined below), this ""Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation"") or required by applicable law, shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall have the same rights, privileges and powers, rank equally (including as to dividends and distributions, and upon any liquidation, dissolution, distribution of assets or winding up of the Corporation), share ratably and be identical in all respects and as to all matters. The voting, dividend, liquidation and other rights, powers and preferences of the holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock are subject to and qualified by the rights, powers and preferences of the holders of the Preferred Stock of any series as may be designated by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the ""Board"") upon any issuance of the Preferred Stock of any series.

2. Voting. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, at all meetings of stockholders and on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation generally, each holder of Class A Common Stock, as such, shall have the right to one (1) vote per share of Class A Common Stock held of record by such holder and each holder of Class B Common Stock, as such, shall have the right to twenty (20) votes per share of Class B Common Stock held of record by such holder. Except as otherwise required by applicable law or provided in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, as such, shall (a) at all times vote together as a single class on all matters (including the election of directors) submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation generally, (b) be entitled to notice of any stockholders' meeting in accordance with the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Corporation, as the same may be amended and/or restated from time to time (the ""Bylaws""), and (c) be entitled to vote upon such matters and in such manner as may be provided by applicable law; provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by applicable law, holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, as such, shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series of Preferred Stock are exclusively entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series of Preferred Stock, to vote thereon pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or applicable law. There shall be no cumulative voting.

6.1 Merger or Consolidation. In the case of any distribution or payment in respect of the shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, or any consideration into which such shares are converted, upon the consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into any other entity, such distribution, payment or consideration that the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock have the right to receive, or the right to elect to receive, shall be made ratably on a per share basis among the holders of the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock as a single class; provided, however, that shares of such classes may receive, or have the right to elect to receive, different or disproportionate distribution, payment or consideration in connection with such consolidation, merger or other transaction in order to reflect the special rights, powers and privileges of holders of shares of Class B Common Stock under this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (which may include, without limitation, securities distributable to the holders of, or issuable upon the conversion of, each share of Class B Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such transaction having up to twenty (20) times the voting power of any securities distributable to the holders of, or issuable upon the conversion of, each share of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such transaction) or such other rights, powers, privileges or other terms that are no more favorable, in the aggregate, to the holders of the Class B Common Stock relative to the holders of the Class A Common Stock than those contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

6.2 Third-Party Tender or Exchange Offers. The Corporation may not enter into any agreement pursuant to which a third party may by tender or exchange offer acquire any shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock unless the holders of (a) the Class A Common Stock shall have the right to receive, or the right to elect to receive, the same form of consideration and the same amount of consideration on a per share basis as the holders of the Class B Common Stock would receive, or have the right to elect to receive, and (b) the Class B Common Stock shall have the right to receive, or the right to elect to receive, the same form of consideration and the same amount of consideration on a per share basis as the holders of the Class A Common Stock would receive, or have the right to elect to receive; provided, however, that shares of such classes may receive, or have the right to elect to receive, different or disproportionate consideration in connection with such tender or exchange offer in order to reflect the special rights, powers and privileges of the holders of shares of the Class B Common Stock under this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (which may include, without limitation, securities exchangeable for each share of Class B Common Stock having up to twenty (20) times the voting power of any securities exchangeable for each share of Class A Common Stock) or such other rights, powers, privileges or other terms that are no more favorable, in the aggregate, to the holders of the Class B Common Stock relative to the holders of the Class A Common Stock than those contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

7.4 Policies and Procedures. The Corporation may, from time to time, establish such policies and procedures, not in violation of applicable law or the other provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Corporation, relating to the conversion of the Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock, as it may deem necessary or advisable in connection therewith (it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that this sentence shall not authorize or empower the Corporation to expand upon the events that constitute a Mandatory Class B Conversion Event). If the Corporation has reason to believe that a Transfer or other Conversion Event giving rise to a conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock has occurred but has not theretofore been reflected on the books of the Corporation (or in book-entry as maintained by the transfer agent of the Corporation), the Corporation may request that the holder of such shares furnish affidavits or other evidence to the Corporation as the Corporation deems necessary to determine whether a conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock to Class A Common Stock has occurred, and if such holder does not within ten (10) days after the date of such request furnish sufficient evidence to the Corporation (in the manner provided in the request) to enable the Corporation to determine that no such conversion has occurred, any such shares of Class B Common Stock, to the extent not previously converted, shall be automatically converted into shares of Class A Common Stock and the same shall thereupon be registered on the books and records of the Corporation (or in book-entry as maintained by the transfer agent of the Corporation). In connection with any action of stockholders taken at a meeting, the stock ledger of the Corporation (or in book-entry as maintained by the transfer agent of the Corporation) shall be presumptive evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders and the class or classes or series of shares held by each such stockholder and the number of shares of each class or classes or series held by such stockholder.

9. Protective Provisions. Unless such action is first approved by the affirmative vote (or written consent) of the holders of two-thirds (2/3rd) of the then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, voting as a separate class, in addition to any other vote required by applicable law, this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, prior to the Final Conversion Date, the Corporation shall not, whether by merger, consolidation, certificate of designation or otherwise (i) amend, alter, repeal or waive any provision of Part A of this Article IV (or adopt any provision inconsistent therewith), or (ii) except for the shares of Class B Common Stock issued pursuant to the Merger and as provided in Section 10 below, authorize, or issue any shares of, any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation entitling the holder thereof to more than (1) vote for each share thereof or entitling any class or series of securities to designate or elect directors as a class or series separate from the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.

11. Definitions. For purposes of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation:

""Effective Date"" means the date on which this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is first effective.

""Requisite Stockholder Consent"" means (i) prior to the Voting Threshold Date, the action at a meeting or by written consent (to the extent permitted under this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation) of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of capital stock of the Corporation that would then be entitled to vote in the election of directors at an annual meeting of stockholders, and (ii) on and after the Voting Threshold Date, the action at a meeting or by written consent (to the extent permitted under this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation) of the holders of two-thirds (2/3rds) of the voting power of the shares of capital stock of the Corporation that would then be entitled to vote in the election of directors at an annual meeting of stockholders.

(a) the granting of a revocable proxy to officers or directors of the Corporation at the request of the Board in connection with (i) actions to be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, or (ii) any other action of the stockholders permitted by this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation;

AMENDMENT OF THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change, adopt or repeal any provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of shares of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal, or adopt any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with Articles IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI and XII; provided further, so long as any shares of Class B Common Stock remain outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without the prior affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds (2/3rd) of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, voting as a separate class, in addition to any other vote required by applicable law or this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, directly or indirectly, whether by amendment, or through merger, recapitalization, consolidation or otherwise amend, alter, change, repeal or adopt any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (1) in a manner that is inconsistent with, or that otherwise alters or changes, any of the voting, conversion, dividend or liquidation provisions of the shares of Class B Common Stock or other rights, powers, preferences or privileges of the shares of Class B Common Stock; (2) to provide for each share of Class A Common Stock to have more than one (1) vote per share or any rights to a separate class vote of the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock other than as provided by this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or required by the DGCL; or (3) to otherwise adversely impact or affect the rights, powers, preferences or privileges of the shares of Class B Common Stock in a manner that is disparate from the manner in which it affects the rights, powers, preferences or privileges of the shares of Class A Common Stock; provided further, so long as any shares of Class A Common Stock remain outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without the prior affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, voting as a separate class, in addition to any other vote required by applicable law or this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, directly or indirectly, whether by amendment, or through merger, recapitalization, consolidation or otherwise amend, alter, change, repeal or adopt any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (1) in a manner that is inconsistent with, or that otherwise alters or changes the powers, preferences, or special rights of the shares of Class A Common Stock so as to affect them adversely; or (2) to provide for each share of Class B Common Stock to have more than twenty (20) votes per share or any rights to a separate class vote of the holders of shares of Class B Common Stock other than as provided by this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or required by the DGCL. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) nothing in the immediately preceding provisos shall limit the rights of the Board as specified in Article IV, Section B (as qualified by Article IV, Section 9) or Article VI of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and (ii) notwithstanding anything in this Article V to the contrary, any amendment to a provision that contemplates a specific approval requirement by the stockholders (or any class of capital stock of the Corporation) in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including the definition of Requisite Stockholder Consent and Voting Threshold Date) shall require the greater of (x) the specific approval requirement by the stockholders (or any class of capital stock of the Corporation) contemplated in such provision, and (y) the approval requirements contemplated by this Article V.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by the DGCL, and subject to the terms of any series of Preferred Stock, the Board shall have the power to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present at any regular or special meeting of the Board at which a quorum is present in any manner not inconsistent with the laws of the State of Delaware or this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The stockholders may not adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation, or adopt any provision inconsistent therewith, unless such action is approved, in addition to any other vote required by this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, by the Requisite Stockholder Consent.

Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, (i) the Court of Chancery (the ""Chancery Court"") of the State of Delaware (or, in the event that the Chancery Court does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state courts of the State of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or any other wrongdoing by, any current or former director, officer, other employee or stockholder of the Corporation, (3) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery, (4) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of any provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, or (5) any other action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but subject to the foregoing provisions of this Article XIV, the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any action, suit or proceeding asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. If any action the subject matter of which is within the scope of the preceding sentence is filed in a court other than the applicable courts specified in the immediately preceding sentence (a ""Foreign Action"") in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be deemed to have consented to (a) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the preceding sentence and (b) having service of process made upon such stockholder in any such action by service upon such stockholder's counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such stockholder. This provision will not apply to claims arising under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other federal securities laws for which there is exclusive federal jurisdiction. Any Person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article XIV.

If any provision or provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any circumstance for any reason whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality and enforceability of such provisions in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and (ii) to the fullest extent possible and without limiting any other provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (or any other provision of the Bylaws or any agreement entered into by the Corporation), the provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including, without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to permit the Corporation to protect its directors, officers, employees and agents from personal liability in respect of their good faith service to, or for the benefit of, the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by law.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, each and every Person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest (of any nature whatsoever) in any shares of the capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed, by reason of and from and after the time of such purchase or other acquisition, to have notice of and to have consented to all of the provisions of (a) this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, (b) the Bylaws and (c) any amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws enacted or adopted in accordance with this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws and applicable law.

Additionally, there are specific provisions that require a supermajority vote of the holders of Class B Common Stock, such as: ""so long as any shares of Class B Common Stock remain outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without the prior affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds (2/3rd) of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, voting as a separate class, in addition to any other vote required by applicable law or this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, directly or indirectly, whether by amendment, or through merger, recapitalization, consolidation or otherwise amend, alter, change, repeal or adopt any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation...""

**Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?**

There are two different percentages mentioned:

* A majority of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, which is equivalent to 50%.
* Two-thirds (2/3rd) of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, which is equivalent to 66.67%.

**Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?**

The answer is ""Yes"" for the 66.67% requirement, and ""No"" for the 50% requirement.

**Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?**

The answer is ""Yes"". The supermajority requirement of 66.67% applies to amendments that affect the rights, powers, preferences or privileges of the shares of Class B Common Stock, and also to amendments that are inconsistent with Articles IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI and XII.

B. | Following the surrender of any shares of Class B Common Stock to the Corporation in accordance with this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Corporation will take all actions necessary to retire such shares and such shares shall not be re-issued by the Corporation.

Any adjustment described in this Section 4.3(d) shall become effective at the close of business on the date the combination or subdivision becomes effective. In no event shall the shares of either Class B Common Stock be split, subdivided, or combined (including by way of stock dividend) unless the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock shall be proportionately split, subdivided or combined.

Section 5.5 Preferred Stock - Directors. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article V, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation).

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate or any provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any particular class or series of Stock required by law or by this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by (a) the holders of a majority of the voting power of the Stock while Mr. Fertitta (together with the Fertitta Affiliates) beneficially owns a majority of the voting power of the Stock and (b) at least two-thirds of the voting power of the Stock from and after the time that Mr. Fertitta (together with the Fertitta Affiliates) no longer beneficially owns a majority of the voting power of the Stock; and provided further, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

Section 7.3 Action by Written Consent. Except as otherwise provided by law or by this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation may be effected by an action by written consent in lieu of a meeting with the approval of the holders of outstanding Stock having not less than the minimum voting power that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares of the Stock entitled to vote thereon were present and voted; provided, that from and after the time that Mr. Fertitta (together with the Fertitta Affiliates) no longer beneficially owns a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of the Stock of the Corporation, no action which is required to be taken or which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation may be taken by written consent without a meeting. Any alteration, amendment or repeal of this Section 7.3 shall require the affirmative vote of (a) a majority of the voting power of the all outstanding shares of the Stock of the Corporation while a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of the Stock of the Corporation is owned by Mr. Fertitta (together with the Fertitta Affiliates) and (b) at least two thirds of the voting power of all outstanding shares of the Stock from and after the time that Mr. Fertitta (together with the Fertitta Affiliates) no longer owns a majority of the voting power of the all outstanding shares of the Stock of the Corporation.

The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any indemnitee by this Section 8.2 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under applicable law, this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, a vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) Amendments. Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.2 by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Section 8.2, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any other analogous doctrine, shall not apply with respect to the Corporation or any of its officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, in circumstances where the application of any such doctrine would conflict with any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations they may have as of the date of this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate or in the future, and the Corporation renounces any expectancy that any of the directors or officers of the Corporation will offer any such corporate opportunity of which he or she may become aware to the Corporation, except, the doctrine of corporate opportunity shall apply with respect to any of the directors or officers of the Corporation with respect to a corporate opportunity that was offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation and (i) such opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Corporation to pursue and (ii) the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to the Corporation without violating any legal obligation.

At the Closing: (i) each of the Corporation and any applicable Third-Party Transferee shall deliver the aggregate applicable Purchase Price for the Equity Interests being purchased by it (x) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified in writing by the Unsuitable Person or Affiliate of such Unsuitable Person (as applicable), (y) by unsecured promissory note, or (z) by combination of both as required by the applicable Gaming Authority and, if not so required, as the Corporation may determine in its sole and absolute discretion and (ii) the Unsuitable Person or Affiliate of such Unsuitable Person (as applicable) shall deliver to the Corporation and any applicable Third-Party Transferee such stock powers, assignment instruments and other agreement as are necessary in the judgment of the Corporation to fully convey all right, title and interest in and to the Equity Interests being purchased by each of the foregoing, free and clear of all liens and other encumbrances (other than restrictions on transfer under this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws and applicable law and as set forth in any agreement between the Unsuitable Person or Affiliate of such Unsuitable Person (as applicable) and the Corporation) and to evidence the subordination of any promissory note if required by the Corporation. Such stock powers, assignment instruments and other agreements shall be in a form acceptable to the Corporation and shall include such representations and warranties (including, without limitation, representations and warranties as to title and ownership of the Equity Interests being sold, authorization, execution and delivery of relevant documents and the enforceability of such documents), covenants, releases (including, without limitation, a general release of claims and covenant not to sue in favor of the Corporation or any applicable Third-Party Transferee and each of their respective Affiliates, employees, directors, managers, officers, partners, members and the like with respect to the pre-Closing period) and indemnities as determined by the Corporation in its sole and absolute discretion. Any promissory note shall contain such terms and conditions as the Corporation determines necessary or advisable, including without limitation, prepayment at the maker's option at any time without premium or penalty or subordination provisions. Subject to the forgoing, the principal amount of any promissory note together with any unpaid interest shall be due and payable no earlier than the tenth (10th) anniversary of delivery of such promissory note and interest on the unpaid principal thereof shall be payable annually in arrears at no more than the minimum rate of interest at the time of delivery which can be used without causing additional interest to be imputed pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time, or corresponding provisions of subsequent superseding federal revenue laws. The sale and transfer of the applicable Equity Interests shall be effected automatically at the Closing upon delivery of the Purchase Price in accordance with this Section 10.2(c) without regard to the provision by the Unsuitable Person or Affiliate of such Unsuitable Person (as applicable) of the stock powers, assignment instruments and other agreements described above; provided, however, that the Unsuitable Person or Affiliate of such Unsuitable Person (as applicable) shall continue to have the obligation to the Corporation and any applicable Third-Party Transferee to provide such stock powers, assignment instruments and other agreements.

The right of the Corporation to purchase or cause to be purchased Equity Interests pursuant to this Article X shall not be exclusive of any other rights the Corporation may have or hereafter acquire under any agreement, provision of this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation or otherwise. To the extent permitted under applicable Gaming Laws, the Corporation shall have the right, exercisable in its sole and absolute discretion, to propose that the parties, immediately upon the delivery of the Transfer Notice, enter into an agreement or other arrangement, including, without limitation, a divestiture trust or divestiture plan, which will reduce or terminate an Unsuitable Person's or its Affiliate's Ownership or Control of all or a portion of its Equity Interests.

Section 10.11 Compliance with Gaming Laws. All Equity Interests shall be held subject to the restrictions and requirements of all applicable Gaming Laws. All Persons Owning or Controlling Equity Interests shall comply with all applicable Gaming Laws, including any provisions of such Gaming Laws that require such Person to file applications for Gaming Licenses with, and provide information to, the applicable Gaming Authorities. Any Transfer of Equity Interests may be subject to the prior approval of the Gaming Authorities and/or the Corporation, and any purported Transfer thereof in violation of such requirements shall be void ab initio. This Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate shall be generally subject to the provisions of the applicable Gaming Laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the applicable Gaming Authorities in each applicable Gaming Jurisdiction.

Any officer of the Corporation shall be immediately removed from such position in the event of a New Jersey Adverse Determination with respect to such officer. Each director of the Corporation shall provide, or shall be deemed to have provided, upon such director's qualification, such director's resignation conditioned upon the occurrence of a New Jersey Adverse Determination with respect to such director in accordance with Section 141(b) of the DGCL.

Article XI
AMENDMENT OF FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate or any provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any particular class or series of Stock required by law or by the Bylaws or by this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), any alteration, amendment or repeal of this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate shall require the affirmative vote of (a) the holders of a majority of the voting power of the Stock while Mr. Fertitta (together with the Fertitta Affiliates) beneficially owns a majority of the voting power of the Stock and (b) at least two-thirds of the voting power of the Stock from and after the time that Mr. Fertitta (together with the Fertitta Affiliates) no longer beneficially owns a majority of the voting power of the Stock; provided, that, so long as both shares of Class A Common Stock are outstanding and shares of Class B Common Stock are outstanding, the Corporation shall not amend, alter or repeal any provision of Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate so as to adversely affect the relative rights, preferences, qualifications, limitations or restrictions of either such class of Common Stock as compared to those of the other class of Common Stock without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of each class of Common Stock, voting separately as a class, whose relative rights, preferences, qualifications, limitations or restrictions are adversely affected.

The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force that may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL; and, except as set forth in Article VIII, all rights, preferences and privileges of whatever nature herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the rights reserved in this Article XI.

Section 12.1 Forum. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the ""Court of Chancery"") shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (i) through (iv) above, any claim (A) as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery or (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 12.1 will not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any security of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Section 12.1.

[Signature Page to Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation]","To answer the questions, I will go through the excerpt and identify the relevant provisions.

**Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?**

Yes, there is a provision in Article XI that requires a vote of stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation. Specifically, it states that ""any alteration, amendment or repeal of this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate shall require the affirmative vote of (a) the holders of a majority of the voting power of the Stock while Mr. Fertitta (together with the Fertitta Affiliates) beneficially owns a majority of the voting power of the Stock and (b) at least two-thirds of the voting power of the Stock from and after the time that Mr. Fertitta (together with the Fertitta Affiliates) no longer beneficially owns a majority of the voting power of the Stock.""

**Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?**

The percentage of shareholders required for the amendment is 50% while Mr. Fertitta (together with the Fertitta Affiliates) beneficially owns a majority of the voting power of the Stock, and 66.67% from and after the time that Mr. Fertitta (together with the Fertitta Affiliates) no longer beneficially owns a majority of the voting power of the Stock.

**Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?**

Yes, the percentage required for the amendment is a supermajority, specifically 66.67%, which is greater than 50%.

**Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?**

The supermajority requirement is not only applied for a subset of articles, but it is also applied to the Certificate of Incorporation as a whole, with certain exceptions. However, there is a specific provision that requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of each class of Common Stock, voting separately as a class, whose relative rights, preferences, qualifications, limitations or restrictions are adversely affected.

Section 4.2 Shares of Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The Board of Directors of the Corporation (the ""Board of Directors"") is hereby authorized to provide from time to time by resolution or resolutions for the creation and issuance, out of the authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock, of one or more series of Preferred Stock by filing a certificate (a ""Certificate of Designation"") pursuant to the DGCL, setting forth such resolution and, with respect to each such series, establishing the designation of such series and the number of shares to be included in such series and fixing the voting powers (full or limited, or no voting power), preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, of the shares of each such series. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the resolution or resolutions providing for the establishment of any series of Preferred Stock may, to the extent permitted by law, provide that such series shall be superior to, rank equally with or be junior to the Preferred Stock of any other series. The powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of each series of Preferred Stock, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, if any, may be different from those of any and all other series at any time outstanding. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the resolution or resolutions providing for the establishment of any series of Preferred Stock, no vote of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock shall be a prerequisite to the issuance of any shares of any series of the Preferred Stock so authorized in accordance with this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Designation establishing a series of Preferred Stock, the Board of Directors may, by resolution or resolutions, increase or decrease (but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding) the number of shares of such series and, if the number of shares of such series shall be so decreased, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series.

(a) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (or any Certificate of Designation made hereunder), the holders of Common Stock shall exclusively possess all voting power with respect to the Corporation. The holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each such share on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders on which the holders of the Common Stock are entitled to vote. The holders of shares of the Common Stock shall at all times vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation.

(b) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (or any Certificate of Designation made hereunder), at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, the holders of the Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and on all other matters properly submitted to a vote of the stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (or any Certificate of Designation made hereunder), the holders of the Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (or any Certificate of Designation made hereunder) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of the Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series of Preferred Stock are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (or any Certificate of Designation made hereunder) or the DGCL.

(a) In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation. In addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation required by applicable law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation in respect of one or more series of Preferred Stock), the adoption, amendment or repeal of the Bylaws of the Corporation by the stockholders of the Corporation shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock, voting together as a single class; provided that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation shall invalidate any prior act of the Board of Directors that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

Section 7.1 To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as the same exists or as may hereafter be amended, a director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the DGCL is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article VII to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as so amended, automatically and without further action, upon the date of such amendment.

Section 7.4 Neither any amendment nor repeal of this Article VII, nor the adoption by amendment of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of any provision inconsistent with this Article VII, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article VII in respect of any matter occurring, or any action or proceeding accruing or arising (or that, but for this Article VII, would accrue or arise) prior to such amendment or repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision.

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by law, no amendment or repeal of this Section 7.5 in accordance with the provisions hereof shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any Exempted Person for or with respect to any activities or opportunities of which such Exempted Person becomes aware prior to such amendment or repeal.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article VIII. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Corporation, and notwithstanding the fact that a lesser percentage may be specified by law, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds in voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required to amend or repeal, or to adopt any provision inconsistent with, this Article VIII. If any provision or provisions of this Article VIII shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any person or entity or circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the validity, legality and enforceability of such provisions in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Article VIII (including, without limitation, each portion of any sentence of this Article VIII containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) and the application of such provision to other persons or entities and circumstances shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any particular class or series of the Voting Stock required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation in respect of one or more series of Preferred Stock), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Articles V, VI, VII and VIII and this Article IX.","To answer the questions, I will go through the excerpt and identify the relevant provisions.

The name of the corporation is Acamar Partners Acquisition Corp. The original Certificate of Incorporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on November 7, 2018. The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on February 21, 2019.

This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation was duly adopted by the board of directors (the ""Board"") of Acamar Partners Acquisition Corp. and by the stockholders in accordance with the provisions of Sections 228, 242 and 245 of the DGCL.

Pursuant to Sections 242 and 245 of the DGCL, the text of the Certificate of Incorporation of Acamar Partners Acquisition Corp. is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

Section 2. Preferred Stock. Shares of Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The Board is hereby authorized at any time, and from time to time, to provide for the issuance of shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series, without approval of the stockholders of the Corporation (except as otherwise provided in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation), by filing a certificate pursuant to the applicable law of the State of Delaware (hereinafter referred to as a ""Preferred Stock Designation""), to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series, and to fix the designations, powers (including voting powers, if any), preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, if any, of the shares of each such series, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, if any, including but not limited to the fixing or alteration of the dividend rights, dividend rate, conversion rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption (including sinking fund provisions), the redemption price or prices, and the liquidation preferences of any wholly unissued series or shares of Preferred Stock. Each such series of Preferred Stock shall have such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, as shall be authorized by the Board and stated in the applicable Preferred Stock Designation. The powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of each series of Preferred Stock, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, if any, may be different from those of any and all other series at any time outstanding. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the authorization providing for the establishment of any series of Preferred Stock, no vote of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock shall be a prerequisite to the issuance of any shares of any series of the Preferred Stock so authorized in accordance with this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Designation establishing a series of Preferred Stock, the Board may, by resolution or resolutions, increase or decrease (but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding) the number of shares of such series and, if the number of shares of such series shall be so decreased, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series. The Corporation shall, from time to time and in accordance with applicable law, increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock if at any time the number of shares of Common Stock remaining unissued and available for issuance shall not be sufficient to permit the conversion of any series of Preferred Stock that, as provided for or fixed pursuant to the provisions of this Article IV, Section 2, is otherwise convertible into Common Stock.

(a) Voting: Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or the relevant Preferred Stock Designation of any class or series of Preferred Stock or required by law, the holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and on all other matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or required by law, each holder of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote in respect of each share of Common Stock held thereby of record on the books of the Corporation for the election of directors and on all other matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation. Except as otherwise required by law, shares of Common Stock shall not entitle the holders thereof to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including to a Preferred Stock Designation) that alters or changes the powers, preferences, rights or other terms of solely one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote on such amendment pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including a Preferred Stock Designation) or pursuant to the DGCL, or if no vote of stockholders is required pursuant to the DGCL.

(g) In addition to the powers and authority herein or by statute expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject to the provisions of the DGCL, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws; provided, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted shall invalidate any prior act of the directors that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

Section 6. Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred on any person by this Article VII shall not be exclusive of any other rights that such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, by-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

Section 9. Amendment or Repeal. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article VII shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification. The rights provided hereunder shall inure to the benefit of any Indemnified Person and such person's heirs, executors and administrators.

Any amendment, repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article VII shall not adversely affect any right or protection of any director, officer or other agent of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or modification.

(d) Any amendment, repeal or modification of this Article VIII, or the adoption of any provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article VIII, shall not adversely affect any right or protection of an Identified Person with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such amendment, repeal, modification or adoption.

Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, (a) the Court of Chancery (the ""Chancery Court"") of the State of Delaware (or, in the event that the Chancery Court does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state courts of the State of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action, suit or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation or to the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action, suit or proceeding arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time) or (iv) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim against the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine; and (b) subject to the preceding provisions of this Article IX, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. If any action the subject matter of which is within the scope of clause (a) of the immediately preceding sentence is filed in a court other than the courts in the State of Delaware (a ""Foreign Action"") in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the provisions of clause (a) of the immediately preceding sentence and (y) having service of process made upon such stockholder in any such action by service upon such stockholder's counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such stockholder.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any particular class or series of the Voting Stock required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation in respect of one or more series of Preferred Stock), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be required (i) to amend or repeal, or adopt any provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with, Articles IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X and this Article XI or (ii) for stockholders of the Corporation to amend or repeal, or adopt, any provision of the Bylaws.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, if any provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation becomes or is declared on any ground by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, unenforceable or void, portions of such provision, or such provision in its entirety, to the extent necessary, shall be severed from this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and the court will replace such illegal, void or unenforceable provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with a valid and enforceable provision that most accurately reflects the Corporation's intent, in order to achieve, to the maximum extent possible, the same economic, business and other purposes of the illegal, void or unenforceable provision. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the balance of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been signed this 21st day of January, 2021.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, the Board is expressly authorized to adopt, make, alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board then in office shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The relevant provision is in Article XI, which states that ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be required (i) to amend or repeal, or adopt any provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with, Articles IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X and this Article XI...""

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""66.67"". This is stated in Article XI as ""sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%)"".

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". Since 66.67% is greater than 50%, it is a supermajority.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Articles IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X and this Article XI"". According to Article XI, the supermajority requirement applies to amendments or repeals of these specific articles.

Section 8.1. Limited Liability of Directors. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no director of the Corporation will have any personal liability to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Neither the amendment nor the repeal of this Article VIII shall eliminate, reduce or otherwise adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the Corporation existing prior to such amendment or repeal.

Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, other employee, agent or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, or any claim for aiding and abetting such alleged breach, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any current or former director, officer, other employee, agent or stockholder of the Corporation (a) arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, this Certificate of Incorporation (as it may be amended or restated) or the By-Laws or (b) as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Delaware Court of Chancery or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any current or former director, officer, other employee, agent or stockholder of the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the law of the State of Delaware shall, as to any action in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be solely and exclusively brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to any claim (a) as to which the Delaware Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (b) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Delaware Court of Chancery, or (c) arising under federal securities laws, including the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as to which the federal district courts of the United States of America shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Article XII will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum. If any action the subject matter of which is within the scope of the forum provisions is filed in a court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (a ""foreign action"") in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an ""enforcement action""); and (y) having service of process made upon such stockholder in any such enforcement action by service upon such stockholder's counsel in the foreign action as agent for such stockholder. Failure to enforce the foregoing provisions would cause the Corporation irreparable harm and the Corporation shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, to enforce the foregoing provisions. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article XII.

Section 13.1. Amendments.

1. Equal Status; General. Except as otherwise provided in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended and/or restated from time to time, including pursuant to any Preferred Stock Designation (as defined below), this ""Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation"") or required by applicable law, shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall have the same rights, privileges and powers, rank equally (including as to dividends and distributions, and upon any liquidation, dissolution, distribution of assets or winding up of the Corporation), share ratably and be identical in all respects and as to all matters. The voting, dividend, liquidation and other rights, powers and preferences of the holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock are subject to and qualified by the rights, powers and preferences of the holders of the Preferred Stock of any series as may be designated by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the ""Board"") upon any issuance of the Preferred Stock of any series.

Except as otherwise required by applicable law, at all meetings of stockholders and on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation generally, each holder of Class A Common Stock, as such, shall have the right to one (1) vote per share of Class A Common Stock held of record by such holder and each holder of Class B Common Stock, as such, shall have the right to twenty (20) votes per share of Class B Common Stock held of record by such holder. Except as otherwise required by applicable law or provided in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, as such, shall (a) at all times vote together as a single class on all matters (including the election of directors) submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation generally, (b) be entitled to notice of any stockholders' meeting in accordance with the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Corporation, as the same may be amended and/or restated from time to time (the ""Bylaws""), and (c) be entitled to vote upon such matters and in such manner as may be provided by applicable law; provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by applicable law, holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, as such, shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series of Preferred Stock are exclusively entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series of Preferred Stock, to vote thereon pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or applicable law. There shall be no cumulative voting.

6.1 Merger or Consolidation. In the case of any distribution or payment in respect of the shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, or any consideration into which such shares are converted, upon the consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into any other entity, such distribution, payment or consideration that the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock have the right to receive, or the right to elect to receive, shall be made ratably on a per share basis among the holders of the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock as a single class; provided, however, that shares of such classes may receive, or have the right to elect to receive, different or disproportionate distribution, payment or consideration in connection with such consolidation, merger or other transaction in order to reflect the special rights, powers and privileges of holders of shares of Class B Common Stock under this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (which may include, without limitation, securities distributable to the holders of, or issuable upon the conversion of, each share of Class B Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such transaction having not more than twenty (20) times the voting power of any securities distributable to the holders of, or issuable upon the conversion of, each share of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such transaction or any other share of stock then outstanding) or such other rights, powers, privileges or other terms that are no more favorable, in the aggregate, to the holders of the Class B Common Stock relative to the holders of the Class A Common Stock than those contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

6.2 Third-Party Tender or Exchange Offers. The Corporation may not enter into any agreement pursuant to which a third party may by tender or exchange offer acquire any shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock unless the holders of (a) the Class A Common Stock shall have the right to receive, or the right to elect to receive, the same form of consideration and the same amount of consideration on a per share basis as the holders of the Class B Common Stock would receive, or have the right to elect to receive, and (b) the Class B Common Stock shall have the right to receive, or the right to elect to receive, the same form of consideration and the same amount of consideration on a per share basis as the holders of the Class A Common Stock would receive, or have the right to elect to receive; provided, however, that shares of such classes may receive, or have the right to elect to receive, different or disproportionate consideration in connection with such tender or exchange offer in order to reflect the special rights, powers and privileges of the holders of shares of the Class B Common Stock under this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (which may include, without limitation, securities exchangeable for each share of Class B Common Stock having twenty (20) times the voting power of any securities exchangeable for each share of Class A Common Stock or any other share of stock then outstanding) or such other rights, powers, privileges or other terms that are no more favorable, in the aggregate, to the holders of the Class B Common Stock relative to the holders of the Class A Common Stock than those contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

7.4 Policies and Procedures. The Corporation may, from time to time, establish such administrative policies and procedures, not in violation of applicable law or the other provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Corporation, relating to the conversion of the Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock, as it may deem necessary or advisable in connection therewith (it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that this sentence shall not authorize or empower the Corporation to expand upon the events that constitute a Mandatory Class B Conversion Event).

9. Protective Provisions. Unless such action is first approved by the affirmative vote (or written consent) of the holders of two-thirds (2/3rd) of the then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, voting as a separate class, in addition to any other vote required by applicable law, this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, prior to the Final Conversion Date, the Corporation shall not, whether by merger, consolidation, certificate of designation or otherwise (i) amend, alter, repeal or waive any provision of Part A of this Article IV (or adopt any provision inconsistent therewith), or (ii) except for the shares of Class B Common Stock issued pursuant to the Merger and as provided in Section 10 below, authorize, or issue any shares of, any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation entitling the holder thereof to more than (1) vote for each share thereof or entitling any class or series of securities to designate or elect directors as a class or series separate from the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.

Signature Page to Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation

The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 628,000,000 shares, consisting of 600,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""Class A Common Stock""), 27,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""Class B Common Stock""), and 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""Preferred Stock""). The number of authorized shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below (i) the number of shares thereof then outstanding and (ii) with respect to the Class A Common Stock, the number of shares of Class A Common Stock reserved pursuant to Section 8 of Part A of this Article IV) by the affirmative vote of the holders of capital stock representing a majority of the voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL.","To answer the questions, I will go through the excerpt and identify the relevant provisions.

**Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?**

Yes, there is a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it. The relevant provision is in Article V, which states that ""the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or adopt any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent therewith.""

Additionally, there are specific provisions that require a supermajority vote of the holders of Class B Common Stock, such as in Article 9, which states that ""the Corporation shall not, without the prior affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds (2/3rds) of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, voting as a separate class, in addition to any other vote required by applicable law or this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, directly or indirectly, whether by amendment, or through merger, recapitalization, consolidation or otherwise amend, alter, change, repeal or adopt any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation...""

**Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?**

The percentage of shareholders required for the amendment is a majority of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. This is equivalent to 50%.

However, there are specific provisions that require a supermajority vote of the holders of Class B Common Stock, which is two-thirds (2/3rds) of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock.

**Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?**

No, the general provision requires a majority vote, which is not a supermajority. However, there are specific provisions that require a supermajority vote of the holders of Class B Common Stock, which is two-thirds (2/3rds) of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock.

**Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?**

Yes, the supermajority requirement is only applied for a subset of articles, specifically those that relate to the rights, powers, and privileges of the holders of Class B Common Stock. The relevant provisions are in Article 9, which states that the Corporation shall not, without the prior affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds (2/3rds) of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, amend, alter, change, repeal or adopt any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that is inconsistent with, or that otherwise alters or changes, any of the voting, conversion, dividend or liquidation provisions of the shares of Class B Common Stock.

The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (the ""First A&R Certificate of Incorporation""), amending and restating the Original Certificate of Incorporation in its entirety, was filed in the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on June 4, 2020.

3.

4. The text of the First A&R Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation is hereby amended and restated to read in its entirety as follows:

2 | Voting. Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as the same may be amended and/or restated from time to time, including the terms of any Preferred Stock Designation (as defined below), this ""Certificate of Incorporation""), each holder of record of Common Stock, as such, shall have one vote for each share of Common Stock which is outstanding in his, her or its name on the books of the Corporation on all matters on which stockholders are entitled to vote generally. Except as otherwise required by law or this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and for all other purposes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, the holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock required by law, by this Certificate of Incorporation or by any Preferred Stock Designation, (A) at any time when RT beneficially owns collectively, in the aggregate, at least 50% in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, an affirmative vote of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required, and (B) at any time when RT beneficially owns collectively, in the aggregate, less than 50% in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, an affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required, in each case, to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, or to adopt any new provision of this Certificate of Incorporation; provided, however, that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the then-outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, any of Article Fifth, Article Sixth, Article Seventh, Article Eighth, Article Ninth, Article Tenth, this Article Eleventh, and Article Twelfth, or in each case, the definition of any capitalized terms used therein or any successor provision (including, without limitation, any such article or section as renumbered as a result of any amendment, alteration, change, repeal or adoption of any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation). Any amendment, repeal or modification of any of Article Fifth, Article Sixth, Article Ninth, Article Tenth, this Article Eleventh and Article Twelfth shall not adversely affect any right or protection of any person existing thereunder with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such amendment, repeal or modification.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be signed by Suying Liu, its Chief Executive Officer, as of February 10, 2021.

TWELFTH: In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of directors present at a regular or special meeting of the Board at which there is a quorum or by unanimous written consent. The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders of the Corporation; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation), (A) at any time when RT beneficially owns collectively, in the aggregate, at least 50% in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, shall be required for the stockholders of the Corporation to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws and (B) at any time when RT beneficially owns collectively, in the aggregate, less than 50% in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required for the stockholders of the Corporation to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and provided further, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

EIGHTH: Unless otherwise required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation), special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time only by the Secretary at the direction of the Board or by the Chairman of the Board; provided, however, that at any time when RT beneficially owns collectively, in the aggregate, at least 50 % in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation for any purpose or purposes shall also be promptly called by the Secretary or by the Chairman of the Board upon the written request of holders of at least 50% in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to matters relating to the purpose or purposes stated in the notice of meeting.

A. Classes of Stock. The total number of shares that the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 155,000,000 shares, which shall be divided into two classes of stock to be designated ""Common Stock"" and ""Preferred Stock."" The total number of shares of Common Stock that the Corporation is authorized to issue is 150,000,000 shares, $0.0001 par value. The total number of shares of Preferred Stock that the Corporation is authorized to issue is 5,000,000 shares, $0.0001 par value. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, the number of authorized shares of any of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL, and no vote of the holders of any of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock voting separately as a class shall be required therefor.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt states that ""an affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation"" (Article ELEVENTH).

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""66.67"". However, the excerpt also mentions that at any time when RT beneficially owns collectively, in the aggregate, at least 50% in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, an affirmative vote of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required (Article ELEVENTH). Therefore, the percentage required is dependent on the ownership percentage of RT.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt requires a supermajority of 66 2/3% in certain circumstances.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Yes"". The supermajority requirement applies to amendments, alterations, changes, or repeals of certain articles, specifically Article Fifth, Article Sixth, Article Seventh, Article Eighth, Article Ninth, Article Tenth, Article Eleventh, and Article Twelfth, or any successor provision.

Here is the JSON object summarizing the answers:

SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

1. The name of the Corporation is ""South Mountain Merger Corp."" (the ""Corporation""). The original certificate of incorporation of the Corporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on February 28, 2019, and was most recently amended and restated on June 19, 2019 (the ""Existing Certificate"").

2. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the ""Restated Certificate""), which both restates and amends the provisions of the Existing Certificate, was duly adopted in accordance with Sections 228, 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended from time to time (the ""DGCL"").

4. The text of the Existing Certificate is hereby restated and amended in its entirety to read as follows:

D. Except as otherwise provided herein, the holders of Class 1 Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share of Class 1 Common Stock held on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation on which holders of Common Stock are entitled to vote. Except as required by law or as otherwise set forth herein, the holders of shares of Class 2 Common Stock shall have no voting rights or power and shall not be entitled to vote on any matter that is submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. Except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Restated Certificate (including any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to law or this Restated Certificate (including any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock). There shall be no cumulative voting and no shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to preemptive or subscription rights. The number of authorized shares of Class 1 Common Stock and/or Class 2 Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by (in addition to any vote of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock that may be required) the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of capital stock of the Corporation representing a majority of the votes represented by all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL.

H. The Corporation shall at all times when the Class 2 Common Stock shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued capital stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Class 2 Common Stock, such number of its duly authorized shares of Class 1 Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding Class 2 Common Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Class 1 Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Class 2 Common Stock, the Corporation shall take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Class 1 Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Restated Certificate.

I. Except as expressly provided in Section D of this Article IV above with respect to (i) voting powers and (ii) the Share Distributions (as hereinafter defined), the Class 1 Common Stock and the Class 2 Common Stock shall be identical in all respects and shall be pari passu with one another, and share ratably on a per share basis in respect of, the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets on the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation made in respect of the Common Stock. The Board of Directors may, at its discretion, declare a dividend of any securities of the Corporation or of any other corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other legal entity (a ""Share Distribution"") to the holders of shares of Class 1 Common Stock and Class 2 Common Stock (i) on the basis of a ratable distribution of identical securities to holders of shares of Class 1 Common Stock and Class 2 Common Stock or (ii) on the basis of a ratable distribution of one class or series of securities to holders of shares of Class 1 Common Stock and another class or series of securities to holders of Class 2 Common Stock; provided that the securities so distributed (and, if the distribution consists of convertible or exchangeable securities, the securities into which such convertible or exchangeable securities are convertible or for which they are exchangeable) do not differ in any respect other than (x) differences in their rights (other than voting rights and powers) consistent in all material respects with differences between Class 1 Common Stock and Class 2 Common Stock and (y) differences in their relative voting rights and powers, with holders of shares of Class 2 Common Stock receiving a class or series of such securities having no voting rights or powers and holders of shares of Class 1 Common Stock receiving a class or series of such securities having voting rights or powers (without regard to whether such voting rights or powers are greater or lesser than the voting rights or powers of the Class 1 Common Stock provided in this Restated Charter). In furtherance of the foregoing, the Corporation shall not, whether by merger, consolidation, amendment to this Certificate, operation of law or otherwise, effect any stock split, recapitalization or similar adjustment to either class of its Common Stock unless simultaneously in connection therewith the Corporation effects an identical stock split, recapitalization or similar adjustment to the other classes of its Common Stock.

A. The liability of the directors for monetary damages shall be eliminated to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. In furtherance thereof, a director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing two sentences shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing hereunder with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or modification. If applicable law is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article VI to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director to the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as so amended.

C. Neither the amendment nor repeal of this Article VII, nor the adoption of any provision of this Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation, nor, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, any modification of law, shall adversely affect any right or protection of any Specified Party granted pursuant hereto existing at, or arising out of or related to any event, act or omission that occurred prior to, the time of such amendment, repeal, adoption or modification. This Article VII shall not limit any protections or defenses available to, or indemnification rights of, any director or officer of the Corporation under this Restated Certificate, the Bylaws or applicable law.

A. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and only if all such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of Delaware) and any appellate court therefrom shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the following claims or causes of action: (A) any derivative claim or cause of action brought on behalf of the Corporation; (B) any claim or cause of action for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee, or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders; (C) any claim or cause of action arising out of or pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, this Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (as each may be amended from time to time); (D) any claim or cause of action seeking to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of this Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (as each may be amended from time to time, including any right, obligation, or remedy thereunder); (E) any claim or cause of action as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and (F) any claim or cause of action, governed by the internal-affairs doctrine, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. This Section A of Article VIII shall not apply to claims or causes of action brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""1933 Act""), or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

B. Subject to Sections A and C of Article VI and to the rights of any holders of any shares of Preferred Stock which may from time to time come into existence and be outstanding, the Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal, at any time and from time to time, any provision contained in this Restated Certificate, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, except as provided in Section C of this Article IX, and all rights, preferences and privileges of whatsoever nature conferred upon the stockholders, directors or any other persons whomsoever by and pursuant to this Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended herein are granted subject to this reservation.

C. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Restated Certificate or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any particular class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Restated Certificate or any certificate of designation filed with respect to a series of Preferred Stock, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 662∕3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise) Articles V, VI, VII, VIII and IX.

The Board of Directors is expressly authorized and empowered to adopt, amend or repeal any provisions of the Bylaws of the Corporation. Any adoption, amendment or repeal of the Bylaws of the Corporation by the Board of Directors shall require the approval of a majority of the authorized number of directors. The stockholders shall also have power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation; provided, however, that, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Restated Certificate, such action by stockholders shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 662∕3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

J. The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The Board of Directors is hereby expressly authorized to provide for the issue of all or any of the remaining shares of the Preferred Stock, in one or more series, and to fix the number of shares of such series and to determine or alter for each such series, such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designation, preferences, and relative, participating, optional, or other rights and such qualifications, limitations, or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors and filed in accordance with the DGCL. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock, or any series thereof, may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, without a separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or of any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to the terms of any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The relevant provision is in Section C of Article IX, which states that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise) Articles V, VI, VII, VIII and IX.

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""66.67"". This is stated in Section C of Article IX.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". 66.67% is indeed a supermajority.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Articles V, VI, VII, VIII and IX"". This is stated in Section C of Article IX.

AMCI Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (the ""Corporation""), hereby certifies that this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been duly adopted in accordance with Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the ""DGCL""), and that:

B. The original Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation was filed with the Secretary of the State of Delaware on June 18, 2018; an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation was filed on November 15, 2018; a Certificate of Amendment to such Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation was filed on May 19, 2019; and a further Certificate of Amendment to such Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation was filed on October 16, 2020 (as amended by such amendments, the ""Amended and Restated Certificate"").

C. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation amends and restates the Amended and Restated Certificate.

D. The text of the Amended and Restated Certificate is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

(c) Voting. Each holder of Common Stock, as such, shall be entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held of record by such holder on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote; provided, that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock, as such, shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including, but not limited to, any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including, but not limited to, any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock) or pursuant to the DGCL.

(d) No Class Vote On Changes In Authorized Number of Shares Of Preferred Stock. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, any certificate of designations or any resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of such series of stock adopted by the Board of Directors, the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Common Stock irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL.

(b) Classified Board of Directors. Subject to the special right of the holders of any class or series of stock to elect directors, the Board of Directors shall be classified with respect to the time for which directors severally hold office into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible. The initial Class I Directors shall serve for a term expiring at the first annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation following the filing of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation; the initial Class II Directors shall serve for a term expiring at the second annual meeting of stockholders following the filing of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation; and the initial Class III Directors shall serve for a term expiring at the third annual meeting of stockholders following the filing of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Each director in each class shall hold office until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified. At each annual meeting of stockholders beginning with the first annual meeting of stockholders following the filing of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the successors of the class of directors whose term expires at that meeting shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in the third year following the year of their election, with each director in each such class to hold office until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified.

(a) Limitation of Director Liability. To the fullest extent that the DGCL or any other law of the State of Delaware (as they exist on the date hereof or as they may hereafter be amended) permits the limitation or elimination of the liability of directors, no director of the Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. No amendment to, or modification or repeal of, this Article VI shall adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing hereunder with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such amendment, modification or repeal.

(a) No Action by Written Consent. Except as otherwise provided for or fixed by or pursuant to the provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of Preferred Stock, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation may be effected only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such stockholders.

To the fullest extent permitted by the applicable law and unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum (an ""Alternative Forum Consent""), the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a duty (including any fiduciary duty) owed by any current or former director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any current or former director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent of the Corporation arising out of or relating to any provision of the DGCL or the Corporation's Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (each, as in effect from time to time), or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any current or former director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent of the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware; provided, however, that, in the event that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction over any such action or proceeding, the sole and exclusive forum for such action or proceeding shall be another state or federal court located within the State of Delaware, in each such case, unless the Court of Chancery (or such other state or federal court located within the State of Delaware, as applicable) has dismissed a prior action by the same plaintiff asserting the same claims because such court lacked personal jurisdiction over an indispensable party named as a defendant therein. Unless the Corporation gives an Alternative Forum Consent, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Article VIII will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Failure to enforce the foregoing provisions would cause the Corporation irreparable harm and the Corporation shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, to enforce the foregoing provisions. Any person or entity purchasing, otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article VIII. The existence of any prior Alternative Forum Consent shall not act as a waiver of the Corporation's ongoing consent right as set forth above in this Article VIII with respect to any current or future actions or claims.

ARTICLE IX -- AMENDMENTS TO THE

SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be executed by the officer below this 4th day of February, 2021.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by law, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation, subject to the power of the stockholders of the Corporation to make, alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws; provided, that with respect to the powers of stockholders to make, alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws, the affirmative vote of holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in an election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to make, alter amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The provision is found in Article IX, which states that the affirmative vote of holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in an election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to make, alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation.

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""66.67"". This is explicitly stated in Article IX.

Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". The required percentage of 66.67% is indeed a supermajority.

Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""No"". The supermajority requirement applies to the Bylaws of the Corporation in general, and not to a specific subset of articles.

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The provision is stated in Article 40, which authorizes the General Meeting to amend the Articles of Association.

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is not explicitly stated as a percentage, but it is mentioned that a resolution to amend the Articles of Association requires a proposal from the Board and a mention in the notice of the General Meeting. However, in Article 18.5, it is mentioned that the General Meeting may overrule the binding nature of each nomination by a resolution adopted by a majority of at least two thirds of the votes cast, representing more than half of the issued share capital. This implies that a two-thirds majority is required for certain amendments.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". A two-thirds majority is indeed a supermajority.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Yes"". The supermajority requirement is applied to the amendment of Article 25, as stated in Article 25.6, and to the overruling of the binding nature of each nomination, as stated in Article 18.5.

This Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which both restates and further amends the provisions of the Original Certificate, was duly adopted in accordance with the provisions of Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and by the written consent of the corporation's sole stockholder in accordance with Section 228 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

3. The text of the Original Certificate is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to provide as herein set forth in full.

(a) the holders of the Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors of the Corporation (the ""Directors"" and each, a ""Director"") and on all other matters requiring stockholder action, each outstanding share of Common Stock entitling the holder thereof to one (1) vote on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders of the Corporation for their vote; provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock, as such, shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation (or on any amendment to a certificate of designations of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding) that alters or changes the powers, preferences, rights or other terms of one or more series of Preferred Stock then outstanding if the holders of such affected series of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, on such amendment pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation (or pursuant to any certificate of designations of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding) or pursuant to the DGCL;

1. Action without Meeting. Except as may otherwise be provided by or pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation (or any certificate of designations of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding) with respect to the holders of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, no action that is required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation may be effected by written consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting of stockholders. In addition to any affirmative vote required by law or this Certificate of Incorporation (or any certificate of designations of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding), the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the outstanding shares of capital stock generally entitled to vote, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend, alter, repeal or adopt any provision inconsistent with this Article V, Section 1.

In addition to any affirmative vote required by law or this Certificate of Incorporation (or any certificate of designations of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding), the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the outstanding shares of capital stock generally entitled to vote, voting together as a single class, and the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote thereon as a class, shall be required to amend, alter, repeal or adopt any provision inconsistent with this Article VI, Section 3.

A Director shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of his or her fiduciary duty as a Director, except for liability (a) for any breach of the Director's duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (b) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (c) under Section 174 of the DGCL or (d) for any transaction from which the Director derived an improper personal benefit. If the DGCL is amended after the effective date of this Certificate of Incorporation to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of Directors, then the liability of a Director shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended.

Any amendment, repeal or modification of this Article VII by either of (i) the stockholders of the Corporation or (ii) an amendment to the DGCL, shall not adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or modification with respect to any acts or omissions occurring before such amendment, repeal or modification of a person serving as a Director at the time of such amendment, repeal or modification.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, stockholder approval of the Bylaws shall not be required unless mandated by this Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, or other applicable law.

AMENDMENT OF CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, repeal or adopt this Certificate of Incorporation (or any certificate of designations of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding) in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute and this Certificate of Incorporation (or any certificate of designations of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding), and all rights, preferences or privileges conferred upon stockholders, Directors or any other person by or pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation (or any certificate of designations of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding) are granted subject to this reservation. Except as otherwise required by this Certificate or by law, whenever any vote of the holders of capital stock of the Corporation is required to amend or repeal any provision of this Certificate, such amendment or repeal shall require the affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote on such amendment or repeal, and the affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote thereon as a class, at a duly constituted meeting of stockholders called expressly for such purpose.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has executed and acknowledged this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation as of this day of , .","To answer the questions, I will go through the excerpt and identify the relevant provisions.

Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt states: ""Except as otherwise required by this Certificate or by law, whenever any vote of the holders of capital stock of the Corporation is required to amend or repeal any provision of this Certificate, such amendment or repeal shall require the affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote on such amendment or repeal, and the affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote thereon as a class, at a duly constituted meeting of stockholders called expressly for such purpose.""

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""50"". The excerpt states that the amendment or repeal shall require the affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote on such amendment or repeal.

However, there are also provisions that require a two-thirds (2/3) vote for certain amendments, such as amendments to Article V, Section 1, Article VI, Section 3, and Article VII.

Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"" for certain amendments, and ""No"" for others. The excerpt states that a two-thirds (2/3) vote is required for certain amendments, which is a supermajority. However, for other amendments, a majority vote (50%) is sufficient.

Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Yes"". The supermajority requirement applies to amendments to Article V, Section 1, Article VI, Section 3, and Article VII.

(6) Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock, as such, shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) or pursuant to the DGCL.

(1) Subject to any other provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation, as it may be amended from time to time, holders of shares of Class A Common Stock shall be entitled to receive ratably, in proportion to the number of shares of Class A Common Stock held by them, such dividends and other distributions in cash, stock or property of the Corporation when, as and if declared thereon by the board of directors of the Corporation (the ""Board of Directors"") from time to time out of assets or funds of the Corporation legally available therefor. Except as provided in Clause (B)(iv) of this Article FOURTH, dividends and other distributions shall not be declared or paid on the Class B Common Stock.

(2) Subject to any other provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation, as it may be amended from time to time, holders of shares of Class C Common Stock shall be entitled to receive ratably, in proportion to the number of shares held by them, the dividends and other distributions in cash, stock or property of the Corporation payable or to be made on outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock that would have been payable on the shares of Class C Common Stock if each such share of Class C Common Stock had been converted into a fraction of a share of Class A Common Stock equal to the Conversion Ratio immediately prior to the record date for such dividend or distribution. The holders of shares of Class C Common Stock shall be entitled to receive, on a pari passu basis with the holders of the Class A Common Stock, such dividend or other distribution on the Class A Common Stock when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors from time to time out of assets or funds of the Corporation legally available therefor.

(ix) Company Conversion of Class B Common Stock. Immediately and automatically upon the earlier of (the ""Effective Time"") (1) July 4, 2024 and (2) the date on which there are no amounts owed to any lender pursuant to the Credit Agreement, dated as of July 3, 2018, among DMSH, Digital Media Solutions, LLC (""DMS""), each of the affiliates of DMS party thereto as borrowers, each of the guarantors party thereto, each of the lenders thereunder, the other financial institutions party thereto and Monroe Capital Management Advisors LLC, as administrative agent for the lenders (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time), each share of Class B Common Stock (the ""Old Class B Common Stock"") shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be reclassified as and changed, pursuant to a reverse stock split (the ""Reverse Split""), into a fraction of a share of the Corporation's outstanding Class B Common Stock equal to the Conversion Ratio (the ""New Class B Common Stock""), subject to the treatment of fractional interests as described below. Each holder, if any, of a certificate or certificates, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Old Class B Common Stock (the ""Old Certificates""), shall be entitled to receive, upon surrender of such Old Certificates to the Corporation's transfer agent for cancellation, a certificate or certificates (the ""New Certificates"") (or book-entries made in lieu thereof) representing the number of whole shares of the New Class B Common Stock into and for which the shares of the Old Class B Common Stock formerly represented by such Old Certificates so surrendered are reclassified under the terms hereof. From and after the Effective Time, the Old Certificates shall thereupon be deemed for all corporate purposes to evidence ownership of New Class B Common Stock in the appropriately reduced whole number of shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional interests in New Class B Common Stock will be issued, and no such fractional interest will entitle the holder thereof to vote, or to any rights of a stockholder of the Corporation. In lieu of any fraction of a share of New Class B Common Stock to which the holder would otherwise be entitled pursuant hereto (taking into account all shares of capital stock owned by such holder), the holder will receive cash, without interest, equal to the fair value of one share of Old Class B Common Stock multiplied by such fraction. If more than one Old Certificate shall be surrendered at one time for the account of the same stockholder, the number of full shares of New Class B Common Stock for which New Certificates (or book-entries made in lieu thereof) shall be issued shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares represented by the Old Certificates so surrendered. In the event that the Corporation's transfer agent determines that a holder of Old Certificates has not surrendered all his, her or its certificates for exchange, the transfer agent shall carry forward any fractional interest until all certificates of that holder have been presented for exchange such that any New Class B Common Stock issued for fractional shares to any one holder shall not exceed the one share. If any New Certificate (or book-entries made in lieu thereof) is to be issued in a name other than that in which it was issued, the Old Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the stock transfer tax stamps to the Old Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the person or persons requesting such exchange shall affix any requisite stock transfer tax stamps to the Old Certificates surrendered, or provide funds for their purchase, or establish to the satisfaction of the transfer agent that such taxes are not payable. From and after the Effective Time, the amount of capital shall be represented by the shares of the New Class B Common Stock into which and for which the shares of the Old Class B Common Stock are reclassified, until thereafter reduced or increased in accordance with applicable law. All references in this Certificate of Incorporation, as it may be amended from time to time, to the ""Class B Common Stock"" shall, after the Effective Time, mean the ""New Class B Common Stock.""

SEVENTH: To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, a person who serves as a director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Any repeal or modification of this Article SEVENTH by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation with respect to events occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.

C. Any alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article TENTH shall require the affirmative vote of at least eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding voting stock of the Corporation. Neither the alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article TENTH, nor the adoption of any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation) inconsistent with this Article TENTH, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article TENTH in respect of any business opportunity first identified or any other matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Article TENTH, would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration, amendment, addition, repeal or adoption. This Article TENTH shall not limit any protections or defenses available to, or indemnification or advancement rights of, any director or officer of the Corporation under this Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws or applicable law.

TWELFTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation), in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Certificate of Incorporation and the DGCL, and all rights, preferences and privileges herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation) in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article TWELFTH; provided, however, that the following provisions may be amended, altered, repealed or rescinded, in whole or in part, or any provision inconsistent therewith or herewith may be adopted, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the outstanding voting stock of the Corporation, voting together as a single class: Articles FIFTH, SIXTH, SEVENTH, NINTH, ELEVENTH and TWELFTH; provided, further, that Article TENTH may only be amended as set forth therein; provided, further, that, as long as there are any shares of Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding, the existence of the Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock, and the rights, preferences and privileges conferred upon the holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock in Article SECOND, including those related to the Redemption Right and the Exchange Option, may not be amended, altered, repealed or rescinded, in whole or in part, or any provision inconstant therewith or herewith may be adopted, only by the unanimous affirmative vote of all of the holders of the Class B Common Stock.

ELEVENTH: The Bylaws may be amended, altered, changed or repealed, in whole or in part, either (A) by the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors (subject to any bylaw requiring the affirmative vote of a larger percentage of the members of the Board of Directors) or (B) without the approval of the Board of Directors, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting stock of the Corporation.

(4) Except as otherwise required in this Certificate of Incorporation or by applicable law, the holders of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock shall vote together as a single class on all matters on which stockholders are generally entitled to vote (or, if any holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote together with the holders of Common Stock, as a single class with such holders of Preferred Stock).","Let's break down the excerpt and answer the questions one by one.

Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt contains several provisions that require a vote of stockholders to amend certain sections of the Certificate of Incorporation.

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The excerpt mentions two different percentages:

* 66-2/3% (Article TWELFTH) for amending certain articles (FIFTH, SIXTH, SEVENTH, NINTH, ELEVENTH, and TWELFTH)
* 80% (Article TENTH) for amending Article TENTH
* Unanimous affirmative vote of all holders of Class B Common Stock (Article TWELFTH) for amending certain provisions related to Class B Common Stock

We will use the first percentage mentioned, which is 66-2/3%.

Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". 66-2/3% is indeed a supermajority.

Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Yes"". The supermajority requirement of 66-2/3% is applied to a subset of articles, specifically Articles FIFTH, SIXTH, SEVENTH, NINTH, ELEVENTH, and TWELFTH.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt states that the General Meeting of Shareholders has the power to ""adopt and amend the Articles of Association"" (Artikel 7: Befugnisse).

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""NA"". The excerpt does not specify the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""NA"". Since the percentage is not specified, it is not possible to determine if it is a supermajority.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""NA"". Since the percentage is not specified, it is not possible to determine if the supermajority requirement applies to a subset of articles.

Here is the JSON object summarizing the answers:

· | ""Articles of Association"" are to the amended and restated articles of association of ARYA;

· | to provide that certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation of New Cerevel are subject to the Amended and Restated Registration and Shareholder Rights Agreement;

· | Governing Documents Proposal C--to provide that certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation of New Cerevel are subject to the Amended and Restated Registration and Shareholder Rights Agreement.

Based on the assumptions discussed in ""Business Combination Proposal--Ownership of New Cerevel,"" upon the completion of the Business Combination, the Bain Investor and Pfizer, will own, collectively, approximately 68.57% of the outstanding New Cerevel Common Stock, assuming that none of ARYA's outstanding public shares are redeemed in connection with the Business Combination or approximately 77.69% of the outstanding New Cerevel Common Stock, assuming that, without giving effect to the ARYA Shareholder Transaction Support Agreements entered into by certain public shareholders participating in the PIPE Financing, all of ARYA's outstanding public shares are redeemed in connection with the Business Combination. Furthermore, as discussed under ""Business Combination Proposal--Related Agreements--Registration and Shareholder Rights Agreement,"" so long as they own certain specified amounts of its equity securities, Bain Investor and Pfizer have certain rights to nominate New Cerevel's directors. As long as such persons each own or control a significant percentage of outstanding voting power, they will have the ability to strongly influence all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and the size of our board of directors, any amendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or the approval of any merger or other significant corporate transaction, including a sale of substantially all of our assets. In addition, Bain Investor and Pfizer will have the right to designate directors pursuant to the Amended and Restated Registration and Shareholder Rights agreement. Some of these persons or entities may have interests different than yours. For example, because many of these stockholders purchased their shares at prices substantially below the price at which shares are being sold in this transaction and have held their shares for a longer period, they may be more interested in selling the company to an acquirer than other investors or they may want Cerevel to pursue strategies that deviate from the interests of other stockholders.

The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. While short-term U.S. government treasury obligations currently yield a positive rate of interest, they have briefly yielded negative interest rates in recent years. Central banks in Europe and Japan pursued interest rates below zero in recent years, and the Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve has not ruled out the possibility that it may in the future adopt similar policies in the United States. In the event that we are unable to complete our initial business combination or make certain amendments to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, our public shareholders are entitled to receive their pro-rata share of the proceeds held in the trust account, plus any interest income, net of income taxes paid or payable (less, in the case we are unable to complete our initial business combination, $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses). Negative interest rates could reduce the value of the assets held in trust such that the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders may be less than $10.00 per share.

· | the governing documents of ARYA will be amended and restated and become the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws as described in this proxy statement/prospectus and ARYA's name will change to ""Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc."";

· | the form of the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws will be appropriately adjusted to give effect to any amendments contemplated by the form of certificate of incorporation or the bylaws that are not adopted and approved by the ARYA shareholders, other than the amendments to the ARYA governing documents that are contemplated by the Required Governing Document Proposals, which are a condition to the closing of the Business Combination; and

GOVERNING DOCUMENTS PROPOSAL C--APPROVAL OF PROPOSAL REGARDING CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION BEING SUBJECT TO THE AMENDED AND RESTATED REGISTRATION AND SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS AGREEMENT

This amendment would indicate that the terms of New Cerevel's certificate of incorporation are subject to the terms of Amended and Restated Registration and Shareholder Rights Agreement when such terms are in conflict.

These provisions are intended to ensure that the terms of New Cerevel's certificate of incorporation do not conflict with the rights granted under the Amended and Restated Registration and Shareholder Rights Agreement. See ""Business Combination Proposal--Related Agreements--Amended and Restated Registration and Shareholder Rights Agreement.""

""RESOLVED, as a special resolution, that the provision that certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation of New Cerevel are subject to the Amended and Restated Registration and Shareholder Rights Agreement be approved.""

Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company's memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against willful default, willful neglect, civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. The Existing Governing Documents provide for indemnification of our officers and directors to the maximum extent permitted by law, including for any liability incurred in their capacities as such, except through their own actual fraud, willful default or willful neglect. We will enter into agreements with our directors and officers to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. We expect to purchase a policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance that insures our officers and directors against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify our officers and directors.

Voting rights. Each holder of New Cerevel Common Stock will be entitled to one (1) vote for each share of New Cerevel Common Stock held of record by such holder on all matters voted upon by our stockholders, provided, however, that, except as otherwise required in the Proposed Certificate of Incorporation or by applicable law, the holders of New Cerevel Common Stock will not be entitled to vote on any amendment to our Proposed Certificate of Incorporation that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of New Cerevel Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to our Proposed Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation relating to any series of New Cerevel Preferred Stock) or pursuant to the DGCL.

Dividend rights. Subject to any other provisions of the Proposed Certificate of Incorporation, as it may be amended from time to time, holders of shares of New Cerevel Common Stock will be entitled to receive ratably, in proportion to the number of shares of New Cerevel Common Stock held by them, such dividends and other distributions in cash, stock or property of New Cerevel when, as and if declared thereon by the New Cerevel Board from time to time out of assets or funds of New Cerevel legally available therefor.

Subject to the rights, if any, of any series of New Cerevel Preferred Stock, any director may be removed from office only with cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock (as defined below) of New Cerevel then entitled to vote at an election of directors. Any such director proposed to be removed from office is entitled to advance written notice as described in the Proposed Certificate of Incorporation. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated Registration and Shareholder Rights Agreement, in case the New Cerevel Board or any one or more directors should be so removed, new directors may be elected at the same time for the unexpired portion of the full term of the director or directors so removed.

Amendment to Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws

The DGCL provides generally that the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding stock entitled to vote on amendments to a corporation's certificate of incorporation or bylaws is required to approve such amendment, unless a corporation's certificate of incorporation or bylaws, as the case may be, requires a greater percentage.

The Proposed Certificate of Incorporation will provide that the following provisions therein may be amended, altered, repealed or rescinded only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66-2/3% in voting power of all the then outstanding shares of New Cerevel's stock entitled to vote thereon and the affirmative vote of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote thereon as a class:

The Company will provide the holders (the ""Public Shareholders"") of its Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001, sold in the Initial Public Offering (the ""Public Shares""), with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $10.00 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay income taxes). The per-share amount to be distributed to Public Shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters (as discussed in Note 5). These Public Shares will be classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") Topic 480 ""Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity."" In such case, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, only if a majority of the ordinary shares, represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, voted at a shareholder meeting are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a shareholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association which the Company will adopt upon the consummation of the Initial Public Offering (the ""Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association""), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, shareholder approval of the transactions is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or vote at all. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the initial shareholders (as defined below) have agreed to vote their Founder Shares (as defined below in Note 4) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination. Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company will adopt an insider trading policy which will require insiders to: (i) refrain from purchasing shares during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information and (ii) to clear all trades with the Company's legal counsel prior to execution. In addition, the initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares, private placement shares (the ""Private Placement Shares"") underlying the Private Placement Units and Public Shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of its Business Combination and does not conduct redemptions in connection with its Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association will provide that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a ""group"" (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act"")), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the Class A ordinary shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, without the prior consent of the Company.

The Company's Sponsor, officers and directors (the ""initial shareholders"") have agreed not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (a) that would modify the substance or timing of the Company's obligation to provide holders of its Public Shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with a Business Combination or to redeem 100% of the Company's Public Shares if the Company does not complete its Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, or June 9, 2022 (the ""Combination Period"") or with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of Public Shareholders, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares in conjunction with any such amendment.

The Company will provide the holders (the ""Public Shareholders"") of its Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001, sold in the Initial Public Offering (the ""Public Shares""), with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $10.00 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay income taxes). The per-share amount to be distributed to Public Shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters (as discussed in Note 5). These Public Shares will be classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") Topic 480 ""Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity."" In such case, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, only if a majority of the ordinary shares, represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, voted at a shareholder meeting are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If","To answer the questions, I will go through the excerpt and identify the relevant information.

Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer to Q1 is ""Yes"". The excerpt states: ""The Proposed Certificate of Incorporation will provide that the following provisions therein may be amended, altered, repealed or rescinded only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66-2/3% in voting power of all the then outstanding shares of New Cerevel's stock entitled to vote thereon and the affirmative vote of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote thereon as a class:""

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer to Q2 is ""66.67"". The excerpt states: ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66-2/3% in voting power of all the then outstanding shares of New Cerevel's stock entitled to vote thereon""

Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer to Q3 is ""Yes"". Since 66.67% is greater than 50%, it is a supermajority.

Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer to Q4 is ""No"". The excerpt does not specify that the supermajority requirement only applies to a subset of articles.

2 | An amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which amended and restated the Original Certificate in its entirety, was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in July, 2019 (the ""Existing Certificate"").

3 | Pursuant to Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the ""Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation"") is being amended and restated in connection with the transactions contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among the Corporation, CP II Merger Sub, Inc., Advantage Solutions Inc. and Karman Topco L.P.. dated as of September 7, 2020.

Section 2. Subject to all the rights, powers and preferences of the Preferred Stock and except as provided by law or in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation (as defined below): (i) the holders of the Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors of the Corporation and on all other matters requiring stockholder action, each outstanding share entitling the holder thereof to one vote on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders of the Corporation for their vote; provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock, as such, shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation) that alters or changes the powers, preferences, rights or other terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, on such amendment pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation) or pursuant to the DGCL; (ii) dividends may be declared and paid or set apart for payment upon the Common Stock out of any assets or funds of the Corporation legally available for the payment of dividends, but only when and as declared by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the ""Board"") or any authorized committee thereof; and (iii) upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the net assets of the Corporation shall be distributed pro rata to the holders of the Common Stock.

Section 3. Shares of Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The Board, or any authorized committee thereof, is hereby authorized to provide from time to time by resolution or resolutions for the creation and issuance, out of the authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock, of one or more series of Preferred Stock by filing a certificate (a ""Certificate of Designation"") pursuant to the DGCL, setting forth such resolution or resolutions and, with respect to each such series, establishing the designation of such series and the number of shares to be included in such series and fixing the terms of such series, the voting powers (full or limited, or no voting power), preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, of the shares of each such series. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, the resolution or resolutions providing for the establishment of any series of Preferred Stock may, to the extent permitted by law, provide that such series shall be superior to, rank equally with or be junior to the Preferred Stock of any other series. The terms, voting powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of each series of Preferred Stock may be different from those of any and all other series at any time outstanding. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock), no vote of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock shall be a prerequisite to the issuance of any shares of any series of the Preferred Stock so authorized in accordance with this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock). Except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) or pursuant to the DGCL. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Designation establishing a series of Preferred Stock, the Board may, by resolution or resolutions, increase or decrease (but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding) the number of shares of such series and, if the number of shares of such series shall be so decreased, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of the resolution or resolutions originally fixing the number of shares of such series.

Section 1. Except as otherwise provided in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the DGCL, the business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board. Subject to the terms of the Stockholders Agreement and any special rights of the holders of Preferred Stock to elect directors, the number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board shall be fixed exclusively by one or more resolutions adopted from time to time by the Board. Except as otherwise expressly provided by the bylaws of the Corporation (as the same may be amended and/or restated from time to time, the ""Bylaws"") or delegated by resolution of the Board, the Board shall have the exclusive power and authority to appoint and remove officers of the Corporation.

Section 2. Other than any directors elected by the separate vote of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock, if applicable, the Board shall be and is divided into three classes, designated as Class I, Class II and Class III, as nearly equal in number as possible. The Board may assign members of the Board already in office to such classes as of the effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the ""Effective Time""). Directors shall be assigned to each class in accordance with a resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board. At the first annual meeting of stockholders following the Effective Time, the term of office of the Class I directors shall expire and Class I directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms expired shall be elected for a full term of three years. At the second annual meeting of stockholders following the Effective Time, the term of office of the Class II directors shall expire and Class II directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms expired shall be elected for a full term of three years. At the third annual meeting of stockholders following the Effective Time, the term of office of the Class III directors shall expire and Class III directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms expired shall be elected for a full term of three years. Subject to any special rights of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock to elect directors, at each succeeding annual meeting of stockholders, directors shall be elected for a full term of three years to succeed the directors of the class whose terms expire at such annual meeting. If the number of such directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any such additional director of any class elected to fill a newly created directorship resulting from an increase in such class shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors remove or shorten the term of any incumbent director. Any such director shall hold office until the annual meeting at which his or her term expires and until his or her successor shall be elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation, disqualification or removal from office.

Section 5. During any period when the holders of any series of Preferred Stock have the special right to elect additional directors, upon commencement and for the duration of such period during which such right continues: (i) the then otherwise total authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall automatically be increased by such specified number of additional directors, and the holders of such series of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect the additional directors so provided for or fixed pursuant to the Certificate of Designation establishing such series of Preferred Stock; and (ii) each such additional director shall serve until such director's successor shall have been duly elected and qualified, or until such director's right to hold such office terminates pursuant to the Certificate of Designation establishing such series of Preferred Stock, whichever occurs earlier, subject to his or her earlier death, resignation, disqualification or removal. Except as otherwise provided by this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation establishing any series of Preferred Stock), whenever the holders of any series of Preferred Stock having the special right to elect additional directors are divested of such right pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including pursuant to any such Certificate of Designation), the terms of office of all such additional directors elected by the holders of such series, or elected to fill any vacancies resulting from the death, resignation, disqualification or removal of such additional directors, shall forthwith terminate and the total authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall be reduced accordingly.

Section 1. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL (including Section 102(b)(7)), as the same exists or as may hereafter be amended, a director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the DGCL is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article VII to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as so amended, automatically and without further action, upon the date of such amendment.

Section 4. Neither any amendment or repeal of this Article VII, nor the adoption by amendment of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of any provision inconsistent with this Article VII, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article VII in respect of any matter occurring, or any action or proceeding accruing or arising (or that, but for this Article VII, would accrue or arise) prior to such amendment or repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision.

Section 1. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, (a) the Court of Chancery (the ""Chancery Court"") of the State of Delaware (or, in the event that the Chancery Court does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or, in the event that the federal district court for the District of Delaware does not have jurisdiction, other state courts of the State of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action, suit or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation or to the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action, suit or proceeding arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or the Bylaws or this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as it may be amended and/or restated from time to time) or (iv) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim against the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine; and (b) subject to the preceding provisions of this Article VIII, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. If any action the subject matter of which is within the scope of clause (a) of the immediately preceding sentence is filed in a court other than the courts in the State of Delaware (a ""Foreign Action"") in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the provisions of clause (a) of the immediately preceding sentence and (y) having service of process made upon such stockholder in any such action by service upon such stockholder's counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such stockholder.

3.2 Except as otherwise expressly provided by this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or as provided by law, the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall (a) at all times vote together as a single class on all matters (including the election of directors) submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation, (b) be entitled to notice of any stockholders' meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation (the ""Bylaws"") and (c) be entitled to vote upon such matters and in such manner as may be provided by applicable law; provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock). Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or required by applicable law, each holder of Class A Common Stock shall have the right to one (1) vote per share of Class A Common Stock held of record by such holder and each holder of Class B Common Stock shall have the right to ten (10) votes per share of Class B Common Stock held of record by such holder.

Section 9. The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available, out of its authorized and unissued shares of Class A Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting conversions of shares of Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock, such number of duly authorized shares of Class A Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock. If at any time the number of authorized and unissued shares of Class A Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, the Corporation shall promptly take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose, including, without limitation, obtaining the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Restated Certificate of Incorporation. All shares of Class A Common Stock which are so issuable shall, when issued, be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares. The Corporation shall take all such action as may be necessary to ensure that all such shares of Class A Common Stock may be so issued without violation of any applicable law or regulation.

Section 2. Neither any amendment nor repeal of this Article VII, nor the adoption of any provision of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article VII, shall eliminate, reduce or otherwise adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or adoption of such an inconsistent provision.

Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and only if all such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation; (ii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Corporation or any stockholder to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders; (iii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim against the Corporation or any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Corporation or any stockholder in such stockholder's capacity as such arising out of or pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law, this Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (as each may be amended from time to time); (iv) any action or proceeding to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of this Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (including any right, obligation or remedy thereunder); (v) any action or proceeding as to which the General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and (vi) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation or any stockholder, governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court's having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. This Article X shall not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

Section 1. The Corporation reserves the right to amend or repeal any provision contained in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation in the manner prescribed by the laws of the State of Delaware and all rights conferred upon stockholders are granted subject to this reservation; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation) or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of the stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation), and subject to Sections 1 and 2.1 of Article IV, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal or adopt any provision inconsistent with Sections 1.2 and 2 of Article IV, or Article V, Article VI, Article VI, Article VIII, Article IX, Article X, Article XI, or Section 1 of this Article XII (the ""Specified Provisions""); provided, further, that if two-thirds (2/3) of the Whole Board has approved such amendment or repeal of, or any provision inconsistent with, the Specified Provisions, then only the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, the Specified Provisions.

Section 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation) or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of the stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of Class A Common Stock representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, voting separately as a single class, and the affirmative vote of the holders of Class B Common Stock representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, each voting separately as single classes, shall be required to amend or repeal, or to adopt any provision inconsistent with, Section 3 of Article IV or this Section 2 of Article XII.

The Board shall have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws. Any adoption, amendment or repeal of the Bylaws by the Board shall require the approval of a majority of the Whole Board. The stockholders shall also have power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation) or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser or no vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation required by applicable law or by this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock issued pursuant to any Certificate of Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of the Bylaws; provided, further, that if two-thirds (2/3) of the Whole Board has approved such adoption, amendment or repeal of any provisions of the Bylaws, then only the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of the Bylaws.

1.2 The number of authorized shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of capital stock representing a majority of the voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the General Corporation Law, and no vote of the holders of the Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock voting separately as a class shall be required therefor.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

Yes, there are provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation that require a vote of stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it.

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

There are different percentages required for different sections of the Certificate of Incorporation. For the Specified Provisions (Sections 1.2 and 2 of Article IV, or Article V, Article VI, Article VIII, Article IX, Article X, Article XI, or Section 1 of Article XII), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors is required. However, if two-thirds (2/3) of the Whole Board has approved such amendment or repeal, then only the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors is required.

For Section 3 of Article IV or Section 2 of Article XII, the affirmative vote of the holders of Class A Common Stock representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, voting separately as a single class, and the affirmative vote of the holders of Class B Common Stock representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, each voting separately as single classes, is required.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

Yes, the required percentages are supermajorities.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

Yes, the supermajority requirement is only applied for a subset of articles. For the Specified Provisions (Sections 1.2 and 2 of Article IV, or Article V, Article VI, Article VIII, Article IX, Article X, Article XI, or Section 1 of Article XII), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors is required. For Section 3 of Article IV or Section 2 of Article XII, the affirmative vote of the holders of Class A Common Stock representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, voting separately as a single class, and the affirmative vote of the holders of Class B Common Stock representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, each voting separately as single classes, is required.

The name of the Corporation is ""Fortress Value Acquisition Corp."". The original certificate of incorporation of the Corporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on January 24, 2020 (the ""Original Certificate""). The Corporation filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on April 29, 2020 (the ""First Amended and Restated Certificate"").

2. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the ""Second Amended and Restated Certificate""), which both restates and amends the provisions of the Original Certificate, was duly adopted in accordance with Sections 228, 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended from time to time (the ""DGCL"").

3. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate restates, integrates, and amends the provisions of the First Amended and Restated Certificate. Certain capitalized terms used in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate are defined where appropriate herein.

4. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate shall become effective on the date of filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

5. The text of the First Amended and Restated Certificate is hereby restated and amended in its entirety to read as follows:

(i) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of the Common Stock shall exclusively possess all voting power with respect to the Corporation.

(ii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each such share on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders on which the holders of the Common Stock are entitled to vote.

(iii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, holders of the Common Stock, shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and on all other matters properly submitted to a vote of the stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any amendment to any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series of Preferred Stock, are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

Section 5.1. Board Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, as it may be further amended from time to time, or the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Corporation, as they may be further amended from time to time (""Bylaws""), the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL and, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate.

(b) Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, the Board shall be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I, Class II and Class III. The term of the initial Class I Directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate; the term of the initial Class II Directors shall expire at the second annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate; and the term of the initial Class III Directors shall expire at the third annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate. At each succeeding annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, beginning with the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term or until the election and qualification of their respective successors in office, subject to their earlier death, resignation or removal. Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, if the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director. Subject to the rights of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors pursuant to the terms of one or more series of Preferred Stock, the election of directors shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. The Board is hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or resolutions thereof, to assign members of the Board already in office to the aforesaid classes at the time this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (and therefore such classification) becomes effective in accordance with the DGCL.

Section 5.5. Preferred Stock - Directors. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article V, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) and such directors shall not be included in any of the classes created pursuant to this Article V unless expressly provided by such terms.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and provided further, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

Section 7.3. Action by Written Consent. Except as may be otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected by a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders.

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any indemnitee by this Section 8.2 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate as it may be further amended from time to time, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.2 by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Section 8.2, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

(a) The doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any other analogous doctrine, shall not apply with respect to the Corporation or any of its officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, in circumstances where the application of any such doctrine would conflict with any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations they may have as of the date of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or in the future. In addition to the foregoing, the doctrine of corporate opportunity shall not apply to any other corporate opportunity with respect to any of the directors or officers of the Corporation unless such corporate opportunity is offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation and such opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Corporation to pursue.

(b) Neither the alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article IX, nor the adoption of any provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) inconsistent with this Article IX, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article IX in respect of any business opportunity first identified or any other matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Article IX, would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration, amendment, addition, repeal or adoption. This Article IX shall not limit any protections or defenses available to, or indemnification or advancement rights of, any director or officer of the Corporation under this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws or applicable law.

AMENDMENT OF SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force that may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL; and, except as set forth in Article VIII, all rights, preferences and privileges of whatever nature herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article XI. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any particular class or series of the Corporation required by law or by this Certificate of Incorporation or any certificate of designation filed with respect to a series of Preferred Stock, the affirmative vote of the stockholders holding at least 66.7% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Article V.

Section 12.1. Forum. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (i) through (iv) above, any action as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten (10) days following such determination). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the United States federal securities laws.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Fortress Value Acquisition Corp. has caused this Second Amended and Restated Certificate to be duly executed and acknowledged in its name and on its behalf by an authorized officer as of the date first set forth above.

As a result, at the closing of the Business Combination, the Sponsor will receive 5.8 million shares of New Parent Common Stock, 1.0 million of which will be forfeited. Amendment No.1 further provides that if holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (""Holders"") are issued Bonus Shares (as defined and further described below) pursuant to Section 5.3(e) of the Updated Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as defined below) (i) in an aggregate amount in excess of 1,000,000 shares in respect of a 30-Day VWAP (as defined and further described below) of $13.00 to $15.99, (ii) in an aggregate amount in excess of 750,000 shares in respect of a 30-Day VWAP of $16.00 to $16.99, or (iii) in an aggregate amount in excess of 500,000 shares in respect of a 30-Day VWAP of $17.00 to $17.99 (such excess shares, the ""Excess Bonus Shares"") then the number of Deferred Shares to be released to the Sponsor will be reduced by the number of Excess Bonus Shares issued. Upon the occurrence of any event that precludes all or a portion of the Excess Bonus Shares from being issued (a ""Bonus Share Release Event""), New Parent will issue to the Sponsor an aggregate number of Deferred Shares equal to the number of Excess Bonus Shares that are no longer issuable as a result of such Bonus Share Release Event.

New Parent has revised the form of Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to become effective as of the Second Effective Time (the ""Updated Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation""), which is attached hereto as Appendix D, to reflect the proposed issuance of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. The following summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Updated Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Pursuant to the Updated Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Holders will be entitled to receive, when, if, and as declared by the board of directors of New Parent, cumulative dividends at the Dividend Rate per share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, paid or accrued quarterly in arrears. Such Dividend Rate (as further described in the Updated Amended Restated Certificate of Incorporation) is equal to 5.75% of the then-applicable Liquidation Preference (as defined below). If New Parent fails to pay a dividend for any quarter on a dividend payment date in arrears in cash at the then-prevailing Dividend Rate, then for purposes of calculating the accrual of unpaid dividends for such quarter then ended, dividends will be calculated to have accrued at the then-prevailing Dividend Rate plus 300 basis points (other than for the first quarter in which New Parent fails to pay the dividend in cash on the applicable payment date, which shall accrue at 5.75% per annum). The Dividend Rate will, in no event, exceed an annual rate of 14.50%, and will revert to 5.75% upon New Parent paying in cash all then-accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. If New Parent breaches any of the protective provisions set forth in Section 5.1(a) of the Updated Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or fails to redeem the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock upon the proper exercise of any redemption right by the Holders, the Dividend Rate will increased to an annual rate of 15.00% for so long as such breach or failure to redeem remains in effect.

If New Parent undergoes a Change of Control (as defined in the Updated Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation including, among other things, certain change-in-control transactions, asset sales, or liquidation events), each Holder, at such Holder's election, may require New Parent to purchase (a ""Change of Control Put"") all or a portion of such Holder's shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock that have not been converted, at a purchase price per share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, payable in cash, equal to the greater of (A) the sum of (x) the product of 101% multiplied by $100.00 per share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, adjusted for any Recapitalization Event (the ""Original Issue Price""), plus (y) all accrued but unpaid dividends in respect of such share as of the effective date of the Change of Control or (B) the amount payable in respect of such share in such Change of Control if such share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock immediately prior to such Change of Control (in each case, the ""Change of Control Price""); provided that New Parent will only be required to pay the Change of Control Price to the extent such purchase can be made out of funds legally available therefor. New Parent will pay the Change of Control Price not later than 30 days after the effective date of the Change of Control.

New Parent will not be permitted to issue any shares of preferred stock that rank senior to, or pari passu with, such Series A Convertible Preferred Stock without the consent or affirmative vote of the Holders a majority of the then outstanding shares of such Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Additionally, New Parent will not be permitted to incur indebtedness if the incurrence of such indebtedness results in the Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of February 28, 2020, by and among GPM Investments, LLC, the lenders signatory thereto, the guarantors signatory thereto, and Ares Capital Corporation, as administrative agent for the lenders, as amended, which is attached as Exhibit 10.16 to New Parent's registration statement on Form S-4) being greater than 7:00:1:00. New Parent will also not be permitted to amend, alter, repeal, or waive, (either directly or indirectly by merger, consolidation or otherwise) any provision of the Updated Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or its bylaws, if such action would adversely and materially alter the rights, preferences, privileges, or powers of, or restrictions provided for the benefit to, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.

WHEREAS, in connection with the Transaction, the Subscribers desire to subscribe for and purchase from the Company, and the Company desires to issue and sell to the Subscribers (i) an aggregate of 700,000 shares (the ""Firm Shares"") of the Company's Series A convertible preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""Preferred Shares""), with the terms set forth in the form of amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the Company attached as Exhibit A hereto (as amended, restated, and/or otherwise modified in accordance with its terms, the ""Charter""), and (ii) up to an aggregate of an additional 300,000 Preferred Shares if and to the extent that the Company exercises the right granted to it in Section 1 of this Subscription Agreement (the ""Additional Shares"" and together with the Firm Shares, the ""Acquired Securities""), in each case for a purchase price of $100 per share (the ""Purchase Price"").

[NEITHER THE ISSUANCE AND SALE OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE NOR THE SECURITIES INTO WHICH THESE SECURITIES ARE CONVERTIBLE HAVE BEEN] [THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN] REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD, TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF EXCEPT (I) PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER SUCH ACT OR SUCH LAWS OR (II) AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT AND SUCH LAWS WHICH, IN THE OPINION OF COUNSEL, IS AVAILABLE. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE SECURITIES MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT OR OTHER LOAN OR FINANCING ARRANGEMENT SECURED BY THE SECURITIES.

(x) ""A&R Parentco Charter"" means the Amended and Restated Parentco Certificate of Incorporation, as in effect on the Closing Date.

6. Amendment to Exhibit B of the Agreement (Amended and Restated Parentco Certificate of Incorporation). Exhibit B to the Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to be in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B.

2. This Restated Certificate restates, integrates, and amends the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, in its entirety, as set forth in Exhibit A (this ""Restated Certificate"").

AMENDMENT OF RESTATED CERTIFICATE

The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force that may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Restated Certificate and the DGCL; and, except as set forth in ARTICLE IX, all rights, preferences and privileges of whatever nature herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this ARTICLE XI.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law, by this Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), or by the Bylaws, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and provided further, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

(a) General. Subject to Section 5.4(c), except as set forth herein or as required by applicable law, the Holders and the holders of Common Stock shall vote as a single class on an as-converted basis. Each holder of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote per share of Common Stock then held. Subject to Section 5.4(c), each Holder shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such Holder would be converted as of the record date, without giving effect to any limitations on conversion by the Holder set forth in Section 5.3(g). Subject to Section 5.4(c), the Holders shall be entitled to vote on all matters on which the Common Stock shall be entitled to vote. Holders shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders' meeting in accordance with the Corporation's bylaws, as amended and/or restated from time to time (the ""Bylaws""). Except as set forth herein or as required by applicable law, there shall be no series voting. Fractional votes shall not be permitted, and any fractional voting rights shall be disregarded.

(b) Authorized Shares of Common Stock. Subject to Section 5.3(d)(viii), the number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes represented by all then outstanding shares of voting stock of the Corporation, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL.

Section 6.5. Preferred Stock - Directors. Notwithstanding any other provision of this ARTICLE VI, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) and such directors shall not be included in any of the classes created pursuant to this ARTICLE VI unless expressly provided by such terms.

Except as required by Delaware law, Holders and holders of New Parent Common Stock will vote as a single class on an as-converted basis. Each Holder will be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of New Parent Common Stock into which the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock held by such Holder would be converted as of the record date. However, except as required by applicable law, Holders will not be entitled to vote on any matter presented to the holders of New Parent Common Stock for their action or consideration unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock provide written notification to New Parent that such Holders are electing, on behalf of all Holders, to activate their voting rights. Holders will be and continue to be entitled to vote their shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock unless and until holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock provide further written notice to New Parent that they are electing to deactivate their voting rights.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt states: ""AMENDMENT OF RESTATED CERTIFICATE... The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Restated Certificate... in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Restated Certificate and the DGCL;""

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""NA"" for the Certificate of Incorporation as a whole, but there are specific provisions that require a majority vote of the holders of a particular class or series of stock. For example, Section 5.4(c) requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws.

However, there is a specific provision that requires a supermajority vote: ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the votes represented by all then outstanding shares of voting stock of the Corporation, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL"" is required to increase or decrease the number of authorized shares of Common Stock. But this is not a supermajority vote for amending the Certificate of Incorporation.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""No"" for the Certificate of Incorporation as a whole, but ""Yes"" for specific provisions.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""NA"" for the Certificate of Incorporation as a whole, but ""Yes"" for specific provisions. For example, the provision that requires a majority vote of the holders of a particular class or series of stock is only applied to certain matters, such as the election of directors or the adoption, amendment, alteration or repeal of the Bylaws.

Here is the JSON object that summarizes the answers:

2. The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation attached hereto as Exhibit A, which is incorporated herein by this reference, and which restates, integrates and further amends the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation of this Corporation as heretofore amended and restated, has been duly adopted by the Corporation's Board of Directors and by the stockholders in accordance with Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

3. This Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation shall be effective as of 1:02 pm Eastern Time on November 25, 2020.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be signed by its duly authorized officer on November 25, 2020 and the foregoing facts stated herein are true and correct.

AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

1. Definitions. For purposes of this Amended and Restated Certificate, the following definitions apply:

1.2 ""Amended and Restated Certificate"" means this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation, as defined below), as may be further amended and restated from time to time.

1.16 ""Qualified Stockholder"" means (a) any registered holder of a share of Class B Common Stock as of the Effective Time (as defined under the BCA); (b) any Permitted Transferee; and (c) the initial registered holder of any shares of Class B Common Stock that are originally issued by the Corporation after the Effective Time in compliance with this Amended and Restated Certificate.

2. Identical Rights. Except as otherwise provided in this Amended and Restated Certificate or required by applicable law, shares of Common Stock shall have the same rights and powers, rank equally (including, without limitation, as to any dividends and distributions, any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation and any voting of such shares), share ratably and be identical in all respects as to all matters.

4.4 Election of Directors. Subject to any rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors under circumstances specified in this Amended and Restated Certificate (as modified by any Preferred Stock Designation), (i) prior to the Final Conversion Date, the holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be entitled to elect and remove all directors of the Corporation, and (ii) from and after the Final Conversion Date, if any, the holders of Common Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be entitled to elect and remove all directors of the Corporation.

1. Board Power. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred by statute or by this Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation, the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation.

Neither any amendment, repeal nor elimination of this Article IX, nor the adoption of any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Article IX, shall eliminate, reduce or otherwise adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal, elimination or adoption of such an inconsistent provision.

If any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate becomes or is declared on any ground by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, unenforceable or void, portions of such provision, or such provision in its entirety, to the extent necessary, shall be severed from this Amended and Restated Certificate, and the court will replace such illegal, void or unenforceable provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate with a valid and enforceable provision that most accurately reflects the Corporation's intent, in order to achieve, to the maximum extent possible, the same economic, business and other purposes of the illegal, void or unenforceable provision. The balance of this Amended and Restated Certificate shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.

Except as provided in Article IX above, the Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of the stock of this Corporation required by law or by this Amended and Restated Certificate, from and after the Final Conversion Date, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of the outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal, or adopt any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with, Article III, Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII or this Article X.

2. Amendment of Bylaws. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Board is expressly authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation. The Bylaws of the Corporation may also be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that from and after the Final Conversion Date, the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the total voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the Corporation, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation.

2. Vote to Increase or Decrease Authorized Shares. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, without a vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or of any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to the terms of any Preferred Stock Designation, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

4.3 Authorized Shares. The number of authorized shares of Common Stock or any class or series thereof may be increased or decreased (but not below (i) the number of shares of Common Stock or, in the case of a class or series of Common Stock, such class or series, then outstanding plus (ii) with respect to Class A Common Stock, the number of shares reserved for issuance pursuant to Article V, Section 9) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, voting together as a single class, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law; provided that the number of authorized shares of Class B Common Stock shall not be increased or decreased without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, voting as a separate class.","To answer the questions, I will go through the excerpt and identify the relevant provisions.

The excerpt contains provisions related to the amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and authorized shares.

For Q1, I found the following provision:
""Except as provided in Article IX above, the Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of the stock of this Corporation required by law or by this Amended and Restated Certificate, from and after the Final Conversion Date, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of the outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal, or adopt any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with, Article III, Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII or this Article X.""

This provision indicates that a vote of shareholders is required to amend certain provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation. Therefore, the answer to Q1 is ""Yes"".

For Q2, the provision states that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of the outstanding shares of stock is required. Therefore, the answer to Q2 is ""66.67"".

For Q3, since the required percentage is two-thirds, which is greater than 50%, the answer is ""Yes"".

For Q4, the provision states that the supermajority requirement applies to amendments or repeals of certain articles (Article III, Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, or Article X). Therefore, the answer to Q4 is ""Article III, Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article X"".

A. The name of this corporation is Gores Metropoulos, Inc. Its original Certificate of Incorporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on August 28, 2018. The Corporation filed an amended and restated certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on January 31, 2019 (the ""First Amended and Restated Certificate"").

B. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (this ""Second Amended and Restated Certificate"") was duly adopted by the Board of Directors of this corporation and by the stockholders in accordance with Sections 228, 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

C. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate restates, integrates and amends the provisions of the First Amended and Restated Certificate. Certain capitalized terms used in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate are defined where appropriate herein.

D. The text of the First Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

1.2 Following the filing of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and immediately prior to the Corporation's consummation of any business combination, each share of Class F Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the filing of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate shall automatically be converted into one (1) share of Class A Common Stock without any action on the part of any person, including the Corporation, and concurrently with such conversion, the number of authorized shares of Class F Common Stock shall be reduced to zero. It is intended that the conversion of Class F Common Stock into Class A Common Stock will be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

3.1 Except as otherwise provided in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or required by applicable law, shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall have the same rights and powers, rank equally (including as to dividends and distributions, and upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation), share ratably and be identical in all respects and as to all matters.

3.2 Except as otherwise expressly provided by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or as provided by law, the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall (a) at all times vote together as a single class on all matters (including the election of directors) submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation, (b) be entitled to notice of any stockholders' meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation (the ""Bylaws"") and (c) be entitled to vote upon such matters and in such manner as may be provided by applicable law; provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Certificate of Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Certificate of Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock). Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or required by applicable law, each holder of Class A Common Stock shall have the right to one (1) vote per share of Class A Common Stock held of record by such holder as of the applicable record date and each holder of Class B Common Stock shall have the right to ten (10) votes per share of Class B Common Stock held of record by such holder as of the applicable record date.

Section 4. The Corporation may, from time to time, establish such policies and procedures, not in violation of applicable law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws, relating to the administration of the conversion of shares of the Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock as it may deem necessary or advisable. If the Corporation has reason to believe that a Transfer that is not a Permitted Transfer has occurred, the Corporation may request that the purported transferor furnish affidavits or other evidence to the Corporation as it reasonably deems necessary to determine whether a Transfer that is not a Permitted Transfer has occurred, and if such transferor does not within ten (10) days after the date of such request furnish sufficient (as determined in good faith by the Board) evidence to the Corporation (in the manner provided in the request) to enable the Corporation to determine that no such Transfer has occurred, any such shares of Class B Common Stock, to the extent not previously converted, shall be automatically converted into shares of Class A Common Stock and such conversion shall thereupon be registered on the books and records of the Corporation. In connection with any action of stockholders taken at a meeting, the stock ledger of the Corporation shall be presumptive evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders and the classes of shares held by each such stockholder and the number of shares of each class held by such stockholder.

Section 5. The Corporation shall not (by amendment, merger, consolidation or otherwise), without first obtaining the approval (by vote or written consent, as provided by law) of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, voting as a single class, amend, alter, repeal or waive this Section 5 of Article V.

6.2 ""Effectiveness Date"" shall mean the date of the filing of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate.

Section 8. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Sections 1, 2 or 3 of this Article V, if the date on which any share of Class B Common Stock is converted into Class A Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of Sections 1, 2 or 3 of this Article V occurs after the record date for the determination of the holders of Class B Common Stock entitled to receive any dividend or distribution to be paid on the shares of Class B Common Stock, the holder of such shares of Class B Common Stock as of such record date will be entitled to receive such dividend or distribution on such payment date; provided, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, to the extent that any such dividend or distribution is payable in shares of Class B Common Stock, such dividend or distribution shall be deemed to have been declared, and shall be payable in, shares of Class A Common Stock and no shares of Class B Common Stock shall be issued in payment thereof.

Section 9. The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available, out of its authorized and unissued shares of Class A Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting conversions of shares of Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock, such number of duly authorized shares of Class A Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock. If at any time the number of authorized and unissued shares of Class A Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, the Corporation shall promptly take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose, including, without limitation, obtaining the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate. All shares of Class A Common Stock which are so issuable shall, when issued, be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares. The Corporation shall take all such action as may be necessary to ensure that all such shares of Class A Common Stock may be so issued without violation of any applicable law or regulation.

Section 1. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board, except as otherwise provided by law. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon them by statute or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation.

Section 2. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the total number of directors constituting the Whole Board shall be fixed from time to time exclusively by resolution adopted by a majority of the Whole Board. For purposes of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the term ""Whole Board"" shall mean the total number of authorized directors whether or not there exist any vacancies or unfilled seats in previously authorized directorships.

Section 2. Neither any amendment nor repeal of this Article VII, nor the adoption of any provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Article VII, shall eliminate, reduce or otherwise adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or adoption of such an inconsistent provision.

The Board shall have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws. Any adoption, amendment or repeal of the Bylaws by the Board shall require the approval of a majority of the Whole Board. The stockholders shall also have power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Certificate of Designation) or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser or no vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation required by applicable law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock issued pursuant to any Certificate of Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of the Bylaws; provided, further, that if two-thirds (2/3) of the Whole Board has approved such adoption, amendment or repeal of any provisions of the Bylaws, then only the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of the Bylaws.

Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and only if all such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation; (b) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Corporation or any stockholder to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders; (c) any action or proceeding asserting a claim against the Corporation or any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Corporation or any stockholder in such stockholder's capacity as such arising out of or pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (as each may be amended from time to time); (d) any action or proceeding to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (including any right, obligation or remedy thereunder); (e) any action or proceeding as to which the General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and (f) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation or any stockholder, governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court's having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. This Article X shall not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

If any provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, then such provision shall nonetheless be enforced to the maximum extent possible consistent with such holding and the remaining provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including without limitation, all portions of any section of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall remain in full force and effect.

Section 1. The Corporation reserves the right to amend or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate in the manner prescribed by the laws of the State of Delaware and all rights conferred upon stockholders are granted subject to this reservation; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Certificate of Designation) or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of the stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Certificate of Designation), and subject to Sections 1 and 2.1 of Article IV, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal or adopt any provision inconsistent with Sections 1.3 and 2 of Article IV, or Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article IX, Article X, Article XI, or Section 1 of this Article XII (the ""Specified Provisions""); provided, further, that if two-thirds (2/3) of the Whole Board has approved such amendment or repeal of, or any provision inconsistent with, the Specified Provisions, then only the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, the Specified Provisions.

Section 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Certificate of Designation) or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of the stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Certificate of Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of Class A Common Stock representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, voting separately as a single class, and the affirmative vote of the holders of Class B Common Stock representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, each voting separately as single classes, shall be required to amend or repeal, or to adopt any provision inconsistent with, Section 3 of Article IV or this Section 2 of this Article XII.

1. The original Certificate of Incorporation of Pivotal Investment Corporation II was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on March 20, 2019, and subsequently amended and restated with the filing of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the ""Amended and Restated Certificate"") on July 11, 2019.

2. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation restates, integrates and further amends the provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation was duly adopted in accordance with the provisions of Sections 141(f), 228, 242 and 245 of the DGCL.

3. The text of the Amended and Restated Certificate is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

FIFTH: Upon the filing and effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the ""Effective Time""), each share of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Class A Common Stock""), and Class B Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Class B Common Stock"" and, together with the Class A Common Stock, the ""Old Common Stock""), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without the payment of any additional consideration or other action on the part of the Corporation or the holder thereof, be automatically reclassified as one fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock. Certificates representing shares of Old Common Stock shall, immediately after the Effective Time, be deemed to represent the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Old Common Stock represented thereby shall have been reclassified pursuant to this Article FIFTH. The Corporation may, but shall not be obliged to, issue new certificates representing the shares of Common Stock outstanding as a result of the reclassification provided herein unless and until (i) the certificates representing any shares of Old Common Stock so reclassified are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent or (ii) the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates.

A. Subject to the rights of the holders of shares of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the number of directors shall be fixed from time to time exclusively by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Whole Board. For purposes of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, ""Whole Board"" shall mean the total number of authorized directors whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships. Subject to the rights of the holders of shares of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes: Class A, Class B and Class C. The number of directors in each class shall be as nearly equal as possible. The directors in Class A shall be elected for a term expiring at the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the directors in Class B shall be elected for a term expiring at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and the directors in Class C shall be elected for a term expiring at the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Board of Directors is authorized to assign members of the Board of Directors already in office to such classes upon the classification of the Board of Directors. Commencing at the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and at each annual meeting thereafter, directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms expire shall be elected for a term of office to expire at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders after their election. Except as the DGCL may otherwise require, newly created directorships and any vacancies in the Board of Directors (including unfilled vacancies resulting from the removal of directors for cause) may be filled by the vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, although less than a quorum (as defined in the Bylaws), or by the sole remaining director. All directors shall hold office until the expiration of their respective terms of office and until their successors shall have been elected and qualified. A director elected to fill a vacancy resulting from the death, resignation or removal of a director shall serve for the remainder of the full term of the class of the director whose death, resignation or removal shall have created such vacancy and until his successor shall have been elected and qualified. No decrease in the authorized number of directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.

B. In furtherance and not in limitation of the rights, power, privileges and discretionary authority granted or conferred by the DGCL or other statutes or laws of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors shall have the power, without the assent or vote of the stockholders, to make, alter, amend, change, add to or repeal the Bylaws as provided in the Bylaws. The Corporation may in its Bylaws confer powers upon its Board of Directors in addition to the foregoing and in addition to the powers and authorities expressly conferred upon the Board of Directors by applicable law. The stockholders shall also have power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation; provided, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of the Bylaws of the Corporation; provided, however, that if the Board of Directors recommends that stockholders approve such adoption, amendment or repeal, such adoption, amendment or repeal shall only require, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of the capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of the majority of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

D. In addition to the powers and authorities hereinbefore or by statute expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation; subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the statutes of the State of Delaware, of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and to the Bylaws; provided, however, that no bylaw shall invalidate any prior act of the directors which was valid prior to such bylaw having been made.

A. The personal liability of the directors of the Corporation to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of his or her fiduciary duty as director is hereby eliminated to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL. Any amendment, repeal or modification of this Article Eighth, or the adoption of any provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article Eighth, shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such amendment, repeal or modification. If the DGCL is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article Eighth to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as so amended.

B. The Corporation, to the full extent permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, (i) shall indemnify, advance expenses to and hold harmless (a) its current and former directors and officers and (b) any person who, while a director or officer, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, from and against any and all of the expenses, liabilities, or other matters referred to in or covered by said section as amended or supplemented (or any successor); provided, however, that except with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification or an advancement of expenses, the Corporation shall not be required to indemnify or advance expenses to any such director or officer in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such director or officer unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors and (ii) may provide indemnification or advance expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation or other persons as set forth in the Bylaws of the Corporation and on such terms and conditions and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors in its sole and absolute discretion. Any amendment, repeal or modification of this Article EIGHTH shall not adversely affect any rights or protection existing hereunder with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

A. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery (the ""Chancery Court"") of the State of Delaware (or, in the event that the Chancery Court does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state courts of the State of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time), (iv) any action or proceeding to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws (including any right, obligation, or remedy thereunder) or (v) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section A will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

TENTH: From time to time any of the provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation may be amended, altered, changed or repealed, and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force may be added or inserted in the manner and at the time prescribed by said laws, and all rights at any time conferred upon the stockholders of the Corporation by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation are granted subject to the provisions of this Article Tenth; provided that in addition to the vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of voting stock of the Corporation representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend, alter or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, Articles SIXTH, SEVENTH, EIGHTH, NINTH, and this Article TENTH of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

2. An amended and restated certificate of incorporation which both restated and amended the provisions of the Original Certificate of Incorporation, was duly adopted in accordance with Sections 228, 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended from time to time (the ""DGCL""), and such amended and restated certificate of incorporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on February 20, 2020 (the ""First A&R Certificate of Incorporation""). The name under which the First A&R Certificate of Incorporation was filed is ""dMY Technology Group, Inc.""

3. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (this ""Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation"") was duly adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation and the stockholders of the Corporation in accordance with Sections 228, 242 and 245 of the DGCL.

5. The First A&R Certificate of Incorporation is being amended and restated in connection with the transactions contemplated by that certain Business Combination Agreement, dated as of July 27, 2020, by and among the Corporation, dMY Sponsor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the ""dMY Sponsor""), Rush Street Interactive, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, Rush Street Interactive GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, in its capacity as the Sellers' Representative, and the other parties thereto, as amended and restated by the parties thereto on October 9, 2020 (as further amended, modified, amended and restated, supplemented or waived from time to time, the ""Combination Agreement""). As part of the transactions contemplated by the Combination Agreement, all 5,750,000 shares of the Class B Common Stock of the Corporation were converted on a 1-for-1 basis into 5,750,000 shares of Class A Common Stock of the Corporation such that, at the effectiveness of this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation, only Class A Common Stock remains outstanding. All Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the effectiveness of this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation and all Class A Common Stock issued as part of the Combination Agreement and the Subscription Agreements contemplated by the Combination Agreement shall be Class A Common Stock for all purposes of this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation.

6. This Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation hereby amends and restates the provisions of the First A&R Certificate of Incorporation in its entirety as follows:

Section 4.1 Authorized Capital Stock. The total number of shares of all classes of stock that the Corporation is authorized to issue is 951,000,000 shares, consisting of (i) 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""Preferred Stock""), (ii) 750,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""Class A Common Stock""), and (iii) 200,000,000 shares of Class V common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""Class V Common Stock"" and together with the Class A Common Stock, the ""Common Stock""). The number of authorized shares of any of the Class A Common Stock, Class V Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares of such class or series then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL (or any successor provision thereto), and no vote of the holders of any of the Class A Common Stock, the Class V Common Stock or Preferred Stock voting separately as a class shall be required therefor, unless a vote of any such holder is required pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, (the ""Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation"") or any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock.

(i) Except as otherwise provided in this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation or as provided by law, each holder of record of Class A Common Stock, as such, shall be entitled to one (1) vote for each share of Class A Common Stock held of record by such holder on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote or holders of Class A Common Stock as a separate class are entitled to vote, including the election or removal of directors (whether voting separately as a class or together with one or more classes of the Corporation's capital stock); provided, however, that to the fullest extent permitted by law, holders of Class A Common Stock, as such, shall have no voting power with respect to, and shall not be entitled to vote on, any amendment to this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock) or pursuant to the DGCL.

(ii) Except as otherwise provided in this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation or as provided by law, each holder of record of Class V Common Stock, as such, shall be entitled to one (1) vote for each share of Class V Common Stock held of record by such holder on all matters on which stockholders generally or holders of Class V Common Stock as a separate class are entitled to vote, including the election or removal of directors (whether voting separately as a class or together with one or more classes of the Corporation's capital stock); provided, however, to the fullest extent permitted by law, holders of Class V Common Stock, as such, shall have no voting power pursuant to this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation with respect to, and shall not be entitled to vote on, any amendment to this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock) or pursuant to the DGCL.

(f) Splits. If the Corporation at any time combines or subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, amendment of this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation, scheme, arrangement or otherwise) the number of shares of Class A Common Stock into a greater or lesser number of shares, the shares of Class V Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such subdivision shall be proportionately similarly combined or subdivided such that the ratio of shares of outstanding Class V Common Stock to shares of outstanding Class A Common Stock immediately prior to such subdivision shall be maintained immediately after such combination or subdivision. Any adjustment described in this Section 4.3(f) shall become effective at the close of business on the date the combination or subdivision becomes effective.

Section 8.1 Limited Liability of Directors. To the fullest extent permitted by law, no director of the Corporation will have any personal liability to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Neither the amendment nor the repeal of this Article VIII shall eliminate, reduce or otherwise adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the Corporation existing prior to such amendment or repeal.

(g) Any alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article X shall require the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. Neither the alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article X, nor the adoption of any provision of this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock) inconsistent with this Article X, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article X in respect of any business opportunity first identified or any other matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Article X, would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration, amendment, addition, repeal or adoption. This Article X shall not limit any protections or defenses available to, or indemnification or advancement rights of, any director or officer of the Corporation under this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation, the By-Laws or applicable law.

Section 12.1 Forum. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, other employee or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, or any claim for aiding and abetting such alleged breach, (c) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any director, officer, other employee or stockholder of the Corporation (i) arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation (as it may be amended or restated) or the By-Laws or (ii) as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Delaware Court of Chancery or (d) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any current or former officer or director or other employee or stockholder of the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the law of the State of Delaware shall, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be solely and exclusively brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery; provided, however, that, in the event that the Delaware Court of Chancery lacks subject matter jurisdiction over any such action or proceeding, the sole and exclusive forum for such action or proceeding shall be another state or federal court located within the State of Delaware, in each such case, unless the Court of Chancery (or such other state or federal court located within the State of Delaware, as applicable) has dismissed a prior action by the same plaintiff asserting the same claims because such court lacked personal jurisdiction over an indispensable party named as a defendant therein. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Failure to enforce the foregoing provisions would cause the Corporation irreparable harm and the Corporation shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, to enforce the foregoing provisions. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article XII.

Section 13.1 Amendments. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, at any time when the Sellers and their Permitted Transferees (each as defined in the Investor Rights Agreement) beneficially own, in the aggregate, less than 40% in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, in addition to any vote required by law or as provided in Article X of this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation and without limiting the rights of any party pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, the following provisions in this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation may be amended, altered, repealed or rescinded, in whole or in part, or any provision inconsistent therewith or herewith may be adopted, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class: Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article IX, Article XII and this Article XIII. Except as expressly provided in the foregoing sentence and the remainder of this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation (including Article X of this Section A&R Certificate of Incorporation and any certificate of designations relating to any services of Preferred Stock) and without limiting the rights of any party pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation may be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Rush Street Interactive, Inc. has caused this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be duly executed in its name and on its behalf by an authorized officer as of this 29th day of December, 2020.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law, (i) at any time when the Sellers and their Permitted Transferees (each as defined in the Investor Rights Agreement) beneficially own, in the aggregate, 40% or more of the voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, and without limiting the rights of any party to the Investor Rights Agreement, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required in order for the stockholders of the Corporation to alter, amend, repeal or rescind, in whole or in part, any such provision of the By-Laws of the Corporation, or to adopt any provision inconsistent therewith and (ii) at any time when the Sellers and their Permitted Transferees (each as defined in the Investor Rights Agreement) beneficially own, in the aggregate, less than 40% of the voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, and without limiting the rights of any party to the Investor Rights Agreement, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required in order for the stockholders of the Corporation to alter, amend, repeal or rescind, in whole or in part, any such provision of the By-Laws of the Corporation, or to adopt any provision inconsistent therewith.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as it now exists and as it may hereafter be amended, no current or former director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or hereafter may be amended.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock required by law, by this Certificate of Incorporation or by any Preferred Stock Designation, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, or to adopt any new provision of this Certificate of Incorporation; provided, however, that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, any of Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article XI, Article XII, Article XIII, Article XIV and this sentence of this Certificate of Incorporation, or in each case, the definition of any capitalized terms used therein or any successor provision (including, without limitation, any such article or section as renumbered as a result of any amendment, alteration, change, repeal or adoption of any provision (other than such article or section as renumbered, or this sentence), in each case, of this Certificate of Incorporation).

A. Forum Selection. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers, employees or agents arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time), or (iv) any action asserting a claim asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers, employees or agents governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (i) through (iv) above, any claim as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. This exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act"") or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided by this Certificate of Incorporation, as provided by law or by the resolution(s) or any Preferred Stock Designation providing for the issue of any series of Preferred Stock, the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class V Common Stock will (i) at all times vote together as a single class on all matters (including the election of directors) submitted to a vote or to be acted upon by written consent (if action by written consent of the stockholders is not prohibited at such time under this Certificate of Incorporation) of the stockholders of the Corporation, (ii) be entitled to notice of any stockholders' meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation (as amended from time to time, the ""Bylaws""), and (iii) be entitled to vote upon such matters and in such manner as may be provided by applicable law. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or required by applicable law, each holder of Class A Common Stock will have the right to one (1) vote per share of Class A Common Stock held of record by such holder and each holder of Class V Common Stock will have the right to 175 votes per share of Class V Common Stock held of record by such holder.

The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock that the Corporation is authorized to issue is 3,035,000,000 shares, consisting of (i) 2,750,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Class A Common Stock""), (ii) 10,000,000 shares of Class V common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Class V Common Stock"" and together with Class A Common Stock, ""Common Stock""), and (iii) 275,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""Preferred Stock""). Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, the number of authorized shares of any of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL, and no vote of the holders of any of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock voting separately as a class shall be required therefor.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt states: ""Notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock required by law, by this Certificate of Incorporation or by any Preferred Stock Designation, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation...""

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""50"" for most provisions, but ""66 2/3%"" for certain provisions (Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article XI, Article XII, Article XIII, Article XIV and this sentence of this Certificate of Incorporation).

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"" for the 66 2/3% requirement, but ""No"" for the 50% requirement.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Yes"", the supermajority requirement of 66 2/3% is only applied for a subset of articles, specifically Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article XI, Article XII, Article XIII, Article XIV and this sentence of this Certificate of Incorporation.

THREE: The Company's certificate of incorporation is hereby amended, integrated and restated to read as follows:

(d) ""Certificate of Incorporation"" means the certificate of incorporation of the Company, as amended and/or restated from time to time, including the terms of any certificate of designation of any series of Preferred Stock.

(c) Voting Generally. Except as otherwise required by applicable law or the Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of Preferred Stock, Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall vote together and not as separate series or classes. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, as such, shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation or applicable law.

A. Unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and only if all such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) and any appellate court therefrom shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the following claims or causes of action under Delaware statutory or common law: (A) any derivative claim or cause of action brought on behalf of the Company; (B) any claim or cause of action for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Company, to the Company or the Company's stockholders; (C) any claim or cause of action against the Company or any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Company, arising out of or pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company (as each may be amended from time to time); (D) any claim or cause of action seeking to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company (as each may be amended from time to time, including any right, obligation, or remedy thereunder); (E) any claim or cause of action as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and (F) any claim or cause of action against the Company or any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Company, governed by the internal affairs doctrine or otherwise related to the Company's internal affairs, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court's having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. This Article VII shall not apply to claims or causes of action brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

B. The Company reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in the Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, except as provided in paragraph C. of this Article VIII, and all rights conferred upon the stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

C. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the Voting Power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, Articles V, VI, VII and VIII and (ii) so long as any shares of Class B Common Stock are outstanding, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock shall be required to adopt, amend, alter, waive or repeal any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation in a manner that adversely affects the powers, preferences or rights of the Class B Common Stock or the holders thereof in respect of such shares.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Panacea Acquisition Corp. has caused this Amended and Restated Certificate to be duly executed and acknowledged in its name and on its behalf by an authorized officer as of this 10th day of February, 2021.

C. Bylaws. The Board of Directors is expressly empowered to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company. The stockholders shall also have power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company; provided, however, that, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Company required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, such action by stockholders shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the Voting Power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Company entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

C. The number of authorized shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Voting Power of all of the outstanding shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote thereon, without a separate vote of the holders of the Class A Common Stock, the Class B Common Stock or the Preferred Stock, or of any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to the terms of any certificate of designation with respect to any series of Preferred Stock.

(d) Liquidation Event. So long as any shares of Class B Common Stock are outstanding, the Company shall not effect or approve any Liquidation Event without, in addition to any other vote required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, the written consent or affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock.","To answer the questions, I will go through the excerpt and identify the relevant provisions.

First, I will look for provisions that require a vote of shareholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it.

I found the following relevant provisions:

* Article VIII, paragraph C: ""Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the Voting Power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, Articles V, VI, VII and VIII...""
* Article VIII, paragraph C: ""...and (ii) so long as any shares of Class B Common Stock are outstanding, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock shall be required to adopt, amend, alter, waive or repeal any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation in a manner that adversely affects the powers, preferences or rights of the Class B Common Stock or the holders thereof in respect of such shares.""

Based on these provisions, I will answer the questions as follows:

Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

Answer: Yes

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

Answer: 66.67 (for amendments to Articles V, VI, VII, and VIII) and a majority (50%) for amendments that affect the powers, preferences, or rights of Class B Common Stock

Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

Answer: Yes (for amendments to Articles V, VI, VII, and VIII)

Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

Answer: Yes, the supermajority requirement applies to Articles V, VI, VII, and VIII.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, the holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) or the DGCL.

3. Any repeal or amendment of this Part B of Article SEVENTH by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Part B of Article SEVENTH, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

The Corporation reserves the right at any time from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, and any other provisions authorized by the DGCL may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by law; and all rights, preferences and privileges of whatsoever nature conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons whomsoever by and pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article TENTH. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock required by law or by this Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, any of Parts A and B of Article FOURTH, Article FIFTH, Article SEVENTH, Article EIGHTH, Article NINTH, Article ELEVENTH, Article TWELFTH, and this Article TENTH, and in each case, the definition of any capitalized terms used therein or any successor provision (including, without limitation, any such article or section as renumbered as a result of any amendment, alteration, change, repeal or adoption of any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation). Any amendment, repeal or modification of any of Article SEVENTH, and this sentence shall not adversely affect any right or protection of any person existing thereunder with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

ELEVENTH: In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board is expressly authorized and empowered to adopt, amend or repeal, in whole or in part, the Bylaws by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Whole Board. The stockholders shall also have power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser or no vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation required by applicable law or by this Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the outstanding shares of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of the Bylaws; provided, further, however, that no Bylaw hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that was valid at the time of such act prior to the adoption of such Bylaw.

(a) Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the ""Court of Chancery"") (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the state or federal courts in the State of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, stockholder or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (3) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws (as the foregoing may be amended, modified, supplemented and/or restated from time to time), or (4) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any director or officer or other employee of the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (1) through (4) above, (a) any action as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten (10) days following such determination) and (b) any action asserted to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or, in each case, rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, for which there is exclusive federal or concurrent federal and state jurisdiction.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has executed this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation as of this 26 day of February, 2021.

FOURTH: The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock that the Corporation is authorized to issue is 1,010,000,000 shares, consisting of (i) 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Common Stock""), and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""Preferred Stock""). Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, the number of authorized shares of any of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL, and no vote of the holders of any of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock voting separately as a class shall be required therefor.

G. Removal. Subject to any rights of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock to elect directors, any director or the entire Board may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting as a single class. For purposes of this Section G, ""cause"" shall mean, with respect to any director, (i) the willful failure by such director to perform, or the gross negligence of such director in performing, the duties of a director, (ii) the engaging by such director in willful or serious misconduct that is injurious to the Corporation or (iii) the conviction of such director of, or the entering by such director of a plea of nolo contendere to, a crime that constitutes a felony.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The relevant provision is in Article TENTH, which states that ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, any of Parts A and B of Article FOURTH, Article FIFTH, Article SEVENTH, Article EIGHTH, Article NINTH, Article ELEVENTH, Article TWELFTH, and this Article TENTH...""

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""66.67"". This is stated in Article TENTH as ""66 2/3% in voting power of the outstanding stock of the Corporation"".

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". Since 66.67% is greater than 50%, it is a supermajority.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Parts A and B of Article FOURTH, Article FIFTH, Article SEVENTH, Article EIGHTH, Article NINTH, Article ELEVENTH, Article TWELFTH, and this Article TENTH"". This is stated in Article TENTH as the specific articles that require a supermajority vote to amend.

5. Transfer Rights. Subject to applicable law and the transfer restrictions set forth in Article VII of the bylaws of the Corporation (as such Bylaws may be amended from time to time, the ""Bylaws""), shares of Common Stock and the rights and obligations associated therewith shall be fully transferable to any transferee.

No director of the Corporation shall have any personal liability to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or hereafter may be amended. Any amendment, repeal or modification of this Article IX, or the adoption of any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article IX, shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such amendment, repeal, modification or adoption.

If the DGCL is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article IX to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as so amended.

A. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery (the ""Chancery Court"") of the State of Delaware (or, in the event that the Chancery Court does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state courts of the State of Delaware) and any appellate court thereof shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action, suit or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation or to the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action, suit or proceeding arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or the Bylaws or this Certificate of Incorporation (as either may be amended from time to time), (iv) any action, suit or proceeding as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (v) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim against the Corporation or any current or former director, officer or stockholder governed by the internal affairs doctrine. If any action the subject matter of which is within the scope of the immediately preceding sentence is filed in a court other than the courts in the State of Delaware (a ""Foreign Action"") in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to (a) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence and (b) having service of process made upon such stockholder in any such action by service upon such stockholder's counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such stockholder.

A. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, in addition to any vote required by applicable law, the following provisions in this Certificate of Incorporation may be amended, altered, repealed or rescinded, in whole or in part, or any provision inconsistent therewith or herewith may be adopted, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class: Article V(B), Article VII, Article VIII, Article IX, Article X, Article XI, Article XII and this Article XIII.

F. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws, subject to the power of the stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote with respect thereto to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws. The stockholders of the Corporation shall also have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws; provided, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation required by applicable law or by this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation in respect of one or more series of Preferred Stock) or the Bylaws of the Corporation, the adoption, amendment or repeal of the Bylaws of the Corporation by the stockholders of the Corporation shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of voting stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in an election of directors.

A. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, and shall not be taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any action required or permitted to be taken by the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, voting separately as a series or separately as a class with one or more other such series, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, to the extent expressly so provided by the applicable Certificate of Designation relating to such series of Preferred Stock, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding shares of the relevant series of Preferred Stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

Subject to the rights of any holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock, the number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt states that certain provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation may be amended, altered, repealed or rescinded, in whole or in part, or any provision inconsistent therewith or herewith may be adopted, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class.

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""66.67"". The excerpt states that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon is required.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

SIXTH: No director shall be personally liable to the Corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. If the DGCL is amended hereafter to authorize the further elimination or limitation of the liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as so amended. Any repeal or modification of this Article SIXTH shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

The affirmative vote of at least a majority of the entire Board of Directors shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Corporation's Bylaws. The Corporation's Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors.

(1) Voting. Except as otherwise expressly required by law or provided in this A&R Certificate, and subject to any voting rights provided to holders of Preferred Stock at any time outstanding, the holders of any outstanding shares of Common Stock shall vote together as a single class on all matters with respect to which stockholders are entitled to vote under applicable law, this A&R Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation, or upon which a vote of stockholders is otherwise duly called for by the Corporation.

B. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, but subject to that certain Stockholders Agreement, dated as of March 12, 2021, by and among the Corporation and certain of its stockholders (as amended from time to time, the ""Stockholders Agreement""), the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws, without any action on the part of the stockholders, by the vote of at least a majority of the directors of the Corporation then in office. In addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation required by applicable law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the Bylaws may also be adopted, amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of the shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting as one class.

Subject to the Stockholders Agreement, the Board of Directors is authorized to assign members of the Board of Directors already in office to such classes of the Classified Board, which assignments shall become effective at the same time the Classified Board becomes effective. Subject to the Stockholders Agreement, directors shall be assigned to each class in accordance with a resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors, with the number of directors in each class to be divided as nearly equal as reasonably possible. The initial Class I directors shall serve for a term expiring at the first annual meeting of the stockholders following the date of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate; the initial Class II directors shall serve for a term expiring at the second annual meeting of the stockholders following the date of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate; and the initial Class III directors shall serve for a term expiring at the third annual meeting following the date of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate.

Each director shall hold office until the annual meeting at which such director's term expires and until his or her successor shall be duly elected and qualified at an annual meeting of stockholders in accordance with the terms of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the Bylaws or until his or her earlier resignation, removal from office, death or incapacity.

A. Limitation on Liability. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as the same exists or as may hereafter be amended (including, but not limited to, Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL), a director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the DGCL hereafter is amended to further eliminate or limit the liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation, in addition to the limitation on personal liability provided herein, shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Any repeal or modification of this Paragraph A of Article VII by the stockholders of the Corporation shall be prospective only and shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation with respect to events occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.

A. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, (a) the Court of Chancery (the ""Chancery Court"") of the State of Delaware (or, in the event that the Chancery Court does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state courts of the State of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action, suit or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation or to the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action, suit or proceeding arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or the Bylaws or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (as either may be amended from time to time) or (iv) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim against the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine; and (b) subject to the preceding provisions of this Article VIII, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Any amendment, repeal or modification of any of Paragraph B of Article IV, Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII or this Article IX shall not adversely affect any right or protection of any person existing thereunder with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

B. If any provision or provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any person or entity or circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the validity, legality and enforceability of such provision or provisions in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including, without limitation, each portion this Second Amended and Restated Certificate containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) and the application of such provision to other persons or entities and circumstances shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

Section 2. Amendments to this Certificate of Incorporation. Subject to the rights of holders of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, and in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any particular class or series of the capital stock required by law or otherwise, no provision of ARTICLE FIVE, ARTICLE SIX, ARTICLE SEVEN, ARTICLE NINE, ARTICLE TEN or ARTICLE ELEVEN of this Certificate of Incorporation may be altered, amended or repealed in any respect, nor may any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws inconsistent therewith be adopted, unless in addition to any other vote required by this Certificate of Incorporation or otherwise required by law, (i) prior to the Amendment Trigger Date, such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of Voting Stock, voting together as a single class, and (ii) from and after the Amendment Trigger Date, such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption is approved by the affirmative vote of holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of Voting Stock, voting together as a single class.

Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt contains several provisions that require a vote of stockholders to amend certain sections of the Certificate of Incorporation. For example, Section 4 of ARTICLE EIGHT requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of Voting Stock to alter, amend or repeal, or to adopt any provision inconsistent with, this ARTICLE EIGHT.

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""66.67"". As mentioned earlier, Section 4 of ARTICLE EIGHT requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of Voting Stock.

Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". The required percentage of 66.67% is indeed a supermajority.

Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is not simply ""No"". The supermajority requirement applies to specific sections of the Certificate of Incorporation, including ARTICLE EIGHT, ARTICLE FIVE, ARTICLE SIX, ARTICLE SEVEN, ARTICLE NINE, ARTICLE TEN, and ARTICLE ELEVEN. Therefore, the answer is ""ARTICLE EIGHT, ARTICLE FIVE, ARTICLE SIX, ARTICLE SEVEN, ARTICLE NINE, ARTICLE TEN, and ARTICLE ELEVEN"".

The excerpt appears to be from the Third Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association of Scienjoy Holding Corporation. The relevant provisions related to amendments are found in Clause 12.

Clause 12.1 states that the Company may amend the Memorandum or the Articles by Resolution of Shareholders or by Resolution of Directors, subject to certain exceptions. However, Clause 12.2 provides that the provisions of Regulation 23 of the Articles may only be amended with the consent in writing of or by a resolution passed at a meeting by the attending and voting holders of at least fifty percent (50%) of the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares.

3. The text of the Original Certificate is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law or this Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate (including any amendment to any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series of Preferred Stock are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

Section 5.1 Board Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws (""Bylaws"") of the Corporation, the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL, this Amended and Restated Certificate, and any Bylaws adopted by the stockholders; provided, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

(a) Upon the effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the ""Effective Time""), the total number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors shall be eleven (11). Thereafter, the total number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors shall be such number as may be fixed from time to time exclusively by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the Board of Directors then in office.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and provided further, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

Except as may be otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) relating to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock, subsequent to the consummation of the Offering, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected by a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders.

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any indemnitee by this Section 8.2 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.2 by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Section 8.2, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

The doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any other analogous doctrine, shall not apply with respect to the Corporation or any of its officers or directors in circumstances where the application of any such doctrine to a corporate opportunity would conflict with any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations they may have as of the date of this Amended and Restated Certificate or in the future. In addition to the foregoing, the doctrine of corporate opportunity shall not apply to any other corporate opportunity with respect to any of the directors or officers of the Corporation unless such corporate opportunity is offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation and such opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Corporation to pursue.

This Amended and Restated Certificate shall become effective as of 5:00 PM (Eastern Time) on July 1, 2020.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, GPAQ Acquisition Holdings, Inc. has caused this Amended and Restated Certificate to be duly executed and acknowledged in its name and on its behalf by an authorized officer as of the date first set forth above.

Section 4.2 Preferred Stock. The board of directors of the Corporation (the ""Board"") is hereby expressly authorized to provide out of the unissued shares of the Preferred Stock for one or more series of Preferred Stock and to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series and to fix the voting rights, if any, designations, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, if any, of each such series and any qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, as shall be stated in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board providing for the issuance of such series and included in a certificate of designation (a ""Preferred Stock Designation"") filed pursuant to the DGCL, and the Board is hereby expressly vested with the authority to the full extent provided by law, now or hereafter, to adopt any such resolution or resolutions. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, without a separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to any Preferred Stock Designation.","I will go through the questions one by one.

Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The relevant provision is in Article X, which states that the Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate.

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""NA"" for the entire Certificate of Incorporation, but there is a specific provision for amending the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock, which requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. However, this is not a general provision for amending the Certificate of Incorporation. Therefore, I will answer ""NA"" for the general provision, but note that there is a specific provision for amending the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock that requires a majority vote.

Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""NA"" because the general provision for amending the Certificate of Incorporation does not specify a percentage. However, the specific provision for amending the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock requires a majority vote, which is not a supermajority.

Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""NA"" because there is no general supermajority requirement for amending the Certificate of Incorporation. However, the specific provision for amending the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock requires a majority vote, and this provision only applies to the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock.

Each certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Class A Common Stock (each, a ""Prior Certificate"") shall, until surrendered to the Company in exchange for a certificate representing the same number of shares of Common Stock, automatically represent that number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Class A Common Stock represented by the Prior Certificate shall have been reclassified and redesignated.

Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I, Class II and Class III. The Board of Directors is authorized to assign members of the Board of Directors already in office to Class I, Class II or Class III. The term of the initial Class I Directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company following the effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Certificate; the term of the initial Class II Directors shall expire at the second annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate; and the term of the initial Class III Directors shall expire at the third annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate. At each succeeding annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company, beginning with the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term or until the election and qualification of their respective successors in office, subject to their earlier death, resignation or removal. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, if the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director.

B. 1. BYLAW AMENDMENTS. The Board of Directors is expressly empowered to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company. Any adoption, amendment or repeal of the Bylaws of the Company by the Board of Directors shall require the approval of a majority of the authorized number of directors. The stockholders shall also have power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company; provided, however, that, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Company required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, such action by stockholders shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

B. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company is authorized to provide indemnification of (and advancement of expenses to) directors, officers and agents of the Company (and any other persons to which applicable law permits the Company to provide indemnification) through Bylaw provisions, agreements with such agents or other persons, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise in excess of the indemnification and advancement otherwise permitted by such applicable law. If applicable law is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article VI to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director to the Company shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as so amended.

A. Unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and only if all such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: (A) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company; (B) any action or proceeding (including any class action) asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company's stockholders; (C) any action or proceeding (including any class action) asserting a claim against the Company or any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Company arising out of or pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company (as each may be amended from time to time); (D) any action or proceeding (including any class action) to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company (including any right, obligation or remedy thereunder); (E) any action or proceeding as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; or (F) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director, officer or other employee of the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court's having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. This Article VII shall not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

A. The Company reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, except as provided in paragraph B. of this Article VIII, and all rights conferred upon the stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

B. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any particular class or series of the Company required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any certificate of designation filed with respect to a series of Preferred Stock, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Articles V, VI, VII and VIII.

FOUR: This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been duly approved by the Board of Directors of the Company.

FIVE: This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation was approved by the holders of the requisite number of shares of the Company. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been duly adopted in accordance with the provisions of Sections 242 and 245 of the DGCL by the stockholders of the Company.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be signed on this 1st day of October, 2020.

C. The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The Board of Directors of the Company (the ""Board of Directors"") is hereby expressly authorized to provide for the issue of all or any number of the shares of the Preferred Stock in one or more series, and to fix the number of shares and to determine or alter for each such series, such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designation, preferences, and relative, participating, optional, or other rights and such qualifications, limitations, or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of such shares and as may be permitted by the DGCL. The Board of Directors is also expressly authorized to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series subsequent to the issuance of shares of that series, but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding. In case the number of shares of any series shall be decreased in accordance with the foregoing sentence, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the stock of the Company entitled to vote thereon, without a separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or of any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to the terms of any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt states in Article VIII, Section B: ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Articles V, VI, VII and VIII.""

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""66.67"". This is stated in Article VIII, Section B.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". 66.67% is indeed a supermajority.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Articles V, VI, VII and VIII"". This is stated in Article VIII, Section B.

Section 4.02. Preferred Stock. The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The Board of Directors of the Corporation (the ""Board"") is expressly granted authority to issue shares of the Preferred Stock, in one or more series, and to fix for each such series such voting powers, full or limited, and such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and such qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board providing for the issue of such series (a ""Preferred Stock Designation"") and as may be permitted by the DGCL.

In case the number of shares of any such series shall be so decreased, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series. Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, holders of any series of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to only such voting rights, if any, as shall expressly be granted thereto by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any certificate of designations relating to such series of Preferred Stock).

(a) Voting. Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation):

iii. The holders of shares of any series of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any amendment to any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series of Preferred Stock, as applicable, are entitled exclusively, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL. For the avoidance of doubt, to the fullest extent permitted by law, holders of Common Stock, as such, shall have no voting power with respect to, and shall not be entitled to vote on, the initial adoption of any certificate of designations that establishes, or authorizes the issuance of, any series of Preferred Stock.

iii. At any time when there are no longer any shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding, this Certificate automatically shall be deemed amended to delete this Section 4.03(b) in its entirety and replaced with ""intentionally omitted"".

Section 4.05. No Class Vote on Changes in Authorized Number of Shares of Stock. The number of authorized shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL (or any successor provision thereto), and no vote of the holders of Common Stock or the Preferred Stock voting separately as a class shall be required therefor, unless a vote of any such holder is required pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation).

Section 5.01. Board Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (""Bylaws""), the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the Bylaws.

Section 5.04. Removal. Subject to Section 5.05, and except as otherwise required by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, any or all of the directors may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

Section 5.05. Preferred Stock - Directors. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article V, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or any certificate of designations with respect to any series of Preferred Stock and such directors shall not be included in any of the classes created pursuant to this Article V unless expressly provided by such terms.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders upon obtaining (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, and (ii) any other vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by applicable law, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, by any Preferred Stock Designation or the Bylaws; provided, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

Section 7.03. Action by Written Consent. Except as may be otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock), any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected by a duly called annual or special meeting of such holders and may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders of the Corporation.

Section 8.01. Limitation of Director and Officer Liability. A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. Any amendment, modification or repeal of the foregoing sentence, or any adoption, amendment, modification or repeal of any other provision of this Certificate (including any certificate of designations relating to any series or class of Preferred Stock) inconsistent with the foregoing sentence, shall not reduce, eliminate or adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such adoption, amendment, modification or repeal.

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any indemnitee by this Section 8.02 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.02 by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Section 8.02, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

ARTICLE IX. AMENDMENT OF SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED
CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or any Preferred Stock Designation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL; and, except as set forth in Article VIII, all rights, preferences and privileges of whatever nature herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article IX. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, and notwithstanding that a lesser percentage may be permitted from time to time by applicable law, no provision of Article V, Article VII, Article VIII, this Article IX and Article XI may be altered, amended or repealed in any respect, nor may any provision or bylaw inconsistent therewith be adopted, unless, in addition to any other vote required by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or otherwise required by law, such alternation, amendment, repeal or adoption is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

Section 10.01. Forum. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine, and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder's counsel, except any action (A) as to which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction or (D) any action arising under the federal securities laws, as to which the Court of Chancery and the federal district court for the District of Delaware shall have concurrent jurisdiction.

To the fullest extent permitted by Section 122(17) of the DGCL, the Corporation, on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries, renounces any interest or expectancy of the Corporation and its subsidiaries in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, business opportunities, which are from time to time presented to, or acquired, created or developed by, or which otherwise comes into the possession of Highland Capital Partners 9 Limited Partnership, Highland Capital Partners 9-B Limited Partnership or Highland Entrepreneurs' Fund 9 Limited Patrnership, or any of their managers, officers, directors, agents, stockholders, members, partners, affiliates and subsidiaries (other than the Corporation and its subsidiaries), even if the opportunity is one that the Corporation or its subsidiaries might reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so, and no such person or entity shall be liable to the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries for breach of any fiduciary or other duty, as a director or officer or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such person or entity pursues or acquires such business opportunity, directs such business opportunity to another person or entity or fails to present such business opportunity, or information regarding such business opportunity, to the Corporation or its subsidiaries unless, in the case of any such person who is a director or officer of the Corporation, such business opportunity is expressly offered to such director or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation. Neither the alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article XI, nor the adoption, alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any certificate of designations relating to any series or class of Preferred Stock) inconsistent with this Article XI, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article XI in respect of any business opportunity first identified or any other matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Article XI, would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration, amendment, addition, repeal or adoption.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), holders of shares of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any amendment to any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series of Preferred Stock are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

Section 5.1 Board Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, as it may be further amended from time to time, or the By-Laws of the Corporation (as amended from time to time in accordance with the provisions hereof and thereof, the ""By-Laws""), the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL and this Second Amended and Restated Certificate.

(b) Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, the Board shall be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I, Class II and Class III. The Board is authorized to assign members of the Board already in office to Class I, Class II or Class III. The term of the initial Class I Directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the term of the initial Class II Directors shall expire at the second annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the term of the initial Class III Directors shall expire at the third annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate. At each succeeding annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, beginning with the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, each of the successors elected to replace the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term or until the election and qualification of their respective successors in office, subject to their earlier death, resignation or removal. Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, if the number of directors that constitute the Board is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board shorten the term of any incumbent director. Subject to the rights of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors pursuant to the terms of one or more series of Preferred Stock, the election of directors shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. The Board is hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or resolutions thereof, to assign members of the Board already in office to the aforesaid classes at the time this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (and therefore such classification) becomes effective in accordance with the DGCL.

Section 5.5 Preferred Stock - Directors. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article V, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) and such directors shall not be included in any of the classes created pursuant to this Article V unless expressly provided by such terms.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By-Laws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By-Laws. The By-Laws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By-Laws; and provided further, however, that no By-Laws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such By-Laws had not been adopted.

Section 7.3 Action by Written Consent. Except as may be otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) relating to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected by a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders.

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any indemnitee by this Section 8.2 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate as it may be further amended from time to time, the By-Laws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.2 by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Section 8.2, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

Section 9.1. To the extent allowed by law, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any other analogous doctrine, shall not apply with respect to the Corporation or any of its officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, in circumstances where the application of any such doctrine would conflict with any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations they may have as of the date of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or in the future, and the Corporation renounces any expectancy that any of the directors or officers of the Corporation will offer any such corporate opportunity of which he or she may become aware to the Corporation, except, the doctrine of corporate opportunity shall apply with respect to any of the directors or officers of the Corporation with respect to a corporate opportunity that was offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation and (i) such opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Corporation to pursue and (ii) the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to the Corporation without violating any legal obligation.

Section 9.2 Neither the alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article IX, nor the adoption of any provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) inconsistent with this Article IX, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article IX in respect of any business opportunity first identified or any other matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Article IX, would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration, amendment, addition, repeal or adoption. This Article IX shall not limit any protections or defenses available to, or indemnification or advancement rights of, any director or officer of the Corporation under this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the By-laws or applicable law.

ONE: The name of the corporation is Forum Merger II Corporation, which was the name under which the corporation was originally incorporated. The date of the filing of its original certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware was May 4, 2018 and an amended and restated certificate of incorporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on August 2, 2018.

TWO: This Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which restates, integrates and further amends the certificate of incorporation of the corporation, has been duly adopted by the corporation in accordance with Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and has been adopted by the requisite vote of the stockholders of the corporation in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

THREE: The Certificate of Incorporation of this corporation is hereby amended and restated to read as follows:

B. Effective immediately upon the filing and effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the ""Effective Time""), each share of the Company's Class B Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Class B Common Stock""), that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be reclassified, redesignated and changed into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of the Company's Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Class A Common Stock""). Immediately following the conversion of such Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock, each share of Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding shall, automatically and without further action by any stockholder, be reclassified, redesignated and changed into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Common Stock.

D. Each outstanding share of Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders of the Company for their vote; provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon by law or pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock).

B. 1. BYLAW AMENDMENTS. The Board of Directors is expressly empowered to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company. Any adoption, amendment or repeal of the Bylaws of the Company by the Board of Directors shall require the approval of a majority of the authorized number of directors. The stockholders shall also have power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company with, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Company required by law or by this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

B. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company is authorized to provide indemnification of (and advancement of expenses to) directors, officers and agents of the Company (and any other persons to which applicable law permits the Company to provide indemnification) through Bylaw provisions, agreements with such agents or other persons, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise in excess of the indemnification and advancement otherwise permitted by such applicable law. If applicable law is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article VI to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director to the Company shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as so amended.

A. Unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company's stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director or officer or other employee of the Company arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company; or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director or officer or other employee of the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (i) through (iv) above, any claim (A) as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under federal securities laws, including the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, the provisions of this Section A of this Article VII will not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

E. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any Person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of capital stock of the Company shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of this Article IX. Neither the alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article IX, nor the adoption of any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (or any certificate of designation filed with respect to a series of Preferred Stock) inconsistent with this Article IX, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article IX in respect of any business opportunity first identified or any other matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Article IX, would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration, amendment, addition, repeal or adoption. This Article IX shall not limit any protections or defenses available to, or indemnification or advancement rights of, any director or officer of the Company under this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, any bylaws or applicable law.

X. A. The Company reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, except as provided in paragraph B. of this Article X, and all rights conferred upon the stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

**Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?**

Yes, there are several provisions that require a vote of stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it. For example, Section 2 states that ""no provision of ARTICLE FIVE, ARTICLE SIX, ARTICLE SEVEN, ARTICLE NINE, ARTICLE TEN or ARTICLE ELEVEN of this Certificate of Incorporation may be altered, amended or repealed in any respect... unless... such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of Voting Stock, voting together as a single class"" during a Controlled Period, and by the affirmative vote of holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66&frac23;%) of the voting power of all outstanding shares of Voting Stock, voting together as a single class, other than during a Controlled Period.

**Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?**

There are two different percentages mentioned in the excerpt, depending on whether it is during a Controlled Period or not. During a Controlled Period, a majority (50%) of the voting power of all outstanding shares of Voting Stock is required. Other than during a Controlled Period, at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66&frac23;%) of the voting power of all outstanding shares of Voting Stock is required.

However, for ARTICLE EIGHT, a higher percentage of 80% is required.

**Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?**

Yes, the percentages mentioned are supermajorities. 66&frac23;% and 80% are both greater than 50%.

**Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?**

Yes, the supermajority requirement is only applied for a subset of articles. For ARTICLE EIGHT, an 80% supermajority is required. For ARTICLE FIVE, ARTICLE SIX, ARTICLE SEVEN, ARTICLE NINE, ARTICLE TEN, and ARTICLE ELEVEN, a 66&frac23;% supermajority is required, except during a Controlled Period when a majority is sufficient.

AMENDMENTS OF MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION AND ALTERATION OF CAPITAL

(b). | alter, amend or add to these Articles;","Based on the provided excerpt, I will go through the questions one by one.

Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer to Q1 is ""Yes"" because the excerpt mentions ""alter, amend or add to these Articles"" which implies that there is a provision for amending the Articles.

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

However, the excerpt does not provide the specific percentage of shareholders required for the amendment. Therefore, the answer to Q2 is ""NA"".

Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

Since Q2 is ""NA"", Q3 is also ""NA"".

Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

Similarly, Q4 is also ""NA"" since Q2 and Q3 are ""NA"".

1. The name of the Corporation is ""Healthcare Merger Corp."" The original certificate of incorporation of the Corporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on September 19, 2019 (the ""Original Certificate""). The Corporation filed an amended and restated certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on December 12, 2019 (the ""First Amended and Restated Certificate"").

2. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (this ""Second Amended and Restated Certificate"") was duly adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the ""Board"") and the stockholders of the Corporation in accordance with Sections 228, 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (as amended from time to time, the ""DGCL"").

3. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate restates, integrates, and amends the provisions of the First Amended and Restated Certificate. Certain capitalized terms used in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate are defined where appropriate herein.

4. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate shall become effective on the date of filing with Secretary of State of Delaware.

5. The text of the First Amended and Restated Certificate is hereby restated and amended in its entirety to read as follows:

(i) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of Common Stock shall exclusively possess all voting power with respect to the Corporation.

(iii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, the holders of Common Stock, voting together as a single class, shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and on all other matters properly submitted to a vote of the stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any amendment to any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of the Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series of Preferred Stock, as applicable, are entitled exclusively, either separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

Section 5.1 Board Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, as it may be further amended from time to time, or the Amended and Restated By-Laws of the Corporation, as they may be further amended from time to time (""By-Laws""), the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL and this Second Amended and Restated Certificate.

(a) The total number of directors of the Corporation, other than those who may be elected by the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock voting separately by class or series, shall be fixed from time to time by resolution adopted by at least a majority of the Whole Board. For purposes of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the term ""Whole Board"" shall mean the total number of directors then in office, whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships.

(b) The Board shall be divided, with respect to the time for which its members severally hold office, into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated as Class I, Class II and Class III. The Board is authorized to assign members of the Board already in office to Class I, Class II or Class III at the time the classification becomes effective. The term of the initial Class I Directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the term of the initial Class II Directors shall expire at the second annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the term of the initial Class III Directors shall expire at the third annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate. At each succeeding annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, beginning with the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, each of the successors elected to replace the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term or until the election and qualification of their respective successors in office, subject to their earlier death, resignation or removal. If the number of directors that constitute the Board is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board shorten the term of any incumbent director. Subject to the rights of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors pursuant to the terms of one or more series of Preferred Stock, the election of directors shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. The Board is hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or resolutions thereof, to assign members of the Board already in office to the aforesaid classes at the time this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (and therefore such classification) becomes effective in accordance with the DGCL.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By-Laws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Whole Board shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By-Laws. The By-Laws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser or no vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a two-thirds (2/3) of the voting power of all then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By-Laws; provided, further, however, that if two-thirds (2/3) of the Whole Board has approved such adoption, amendment or repeal of any provisions of the By-Laws, then only the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of the By-Laws; and provided further, however, that no By-Laws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such By-Laws had not been adopted.

Section 7.3 No Action by Written Consent. Except as may be otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) relating to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected by a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders.

Section 8.1 Limitation of Director Liability. A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. Neither any amendment nor repeal of this Article VIII, nor the adoption of any provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Article VIII, shall eliminate, reduce or otherwise adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or adoption of such an inconsistent provision.

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any indemnitee by this Section 8.2 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate as it may be further amended from time to time, the By-Laws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.2 by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Section 8.2, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

(e) To the extent an indemnitee has rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by persons or entities other than the Corporation (collectively, the ""Other Indemnitors""), (i) the Corporation shall be the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., that its obligations to an indemnitee are primary and any obligation of the Other Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by an indemnitee are secondary), (ii) the Corporation shall be required to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by an indemnitee and shall be liable for the full amount of all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses (including amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromises and settlements, as fines and penalties and legal or other costs and reasonable expenses of investigating or defending against any claim or alleged claim) to the extent legally permitted and as required by the terms of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the By-Laws and the agreements to which the Corporation is a party, without regard to any rights an indemnitee may have against the Other Indemnitors, and (iii) the Corporation irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases the Other Indemnitors from any and all claims against them for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect thereof. No advancement or payment by the Other Indemnitors on behalf of an indemnitee with respect to any claim for which an indemnitee has sought indemnification from the Corporation shall affect the foregoing, and the Other Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution and be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of an indemnitee against the Corporation.

ARTICLE IX
AMENDMENT OF SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL and all rights conferred upon stockholders are granted subject to this reservation; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and subject to Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.5 of Article IV, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal any provision inconsistent with this Article IX, Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of Article IV, or Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article X or Article XI (the ""Specified Provisions""); provided, further, that if two-thirds (2/3) of the Whole Board has approved such amendment or repeal of, or any provision inconsistent with, the Specified Provisions, then only the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, the Specified Provisions; and, except as set forth in Article VIII, all rights, preferences and privileges herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article IX.

If any provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, then such provision shall nonetheless be enforced to the maximum extent possible consistent with such holding and the remaining provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including without limitation, all portions of any section of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall remain in full force and effect.

Section 11.1 Forum. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for any (a) derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (b) action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by or other wrongdoing by any current or former director, officer, employee, agent or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (c) action asserting a claim arising under any provision of the DGCL or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws, or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (d) action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (a) through (d) above, any action as to which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware within ten (10) days following such determination), in which case the United States District Court for the District of Delaware or other state courts of the State of Delaware, as applicable, shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for any such claims. This Article XI shall not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any action asserting a claim arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. If any provision or provisions of this Article XI shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any person or entity or circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the validity, legality and enforceability of such provisions in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Article XI (including, without limitation, each portion of any sentence of this Article XI containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) and the application of such provision to other persons or entities and circumstances shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article XI. Failure to enforce the foregoing provisions would cause the Corporation irreparable harm and the Corporation shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, to enforce the foregoing provisions.

Section 12.5 Certain Definitions. For purposes of this Article XII of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the following definitions apply:

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Healthcare Merger Corp. has caused this Second Amended and Restated Certificate to be duly executed and acknowledged in its name and on its behalf by an authorized officer as of the date first set forth above.

In addition, a Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of the Corporation (the ""Certificate of Designation"") was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on June 29, 2020.

3. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the ""Second Amended and Restated Certificate""), which both restates and amends the provisions of the Existing Certificate as heretofore amended and supplemented, was duly adopted in accordance with Sections 228, 242, and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended from time to time (the ""DGCL"").

4. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate shall become effective on the date of filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

5. The text of the Existing Certificate, as heretofore amended and supplemented, is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

Section 4.4 Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. The Certificate of Designations of the Series A Shares was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on June 29, 2020. The provisions of the resolutions set forth in the Certificate of Designation, as amended and restated hereby, are incorporated herein as Section 4.4 of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate. The designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other rights of the Series A Shares shall be as follows:

(10) Noncircumvention. The Corporation hereby covenants and agrees that the Corporation will not, by amendment of its Second Amended and Restated Certificate, Bylaws or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Section 4.4, and will at all times in good faith carry out all the provisions of this Section 4.4 and take all action as may be required to protect the rights of the Holders. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or any other provision of this Section 4.4 or the other Transaction Documents, the Corporation (a) shall not increase the par value of any shares of Common Stock receivable upon the conversion of any Series A Shares above the Conversion Price then in effect, (b) shall take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of Series A Shares and (c) shall, so long as any Series A Shares are outstanding, take all action necessary to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Series A Shares, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion of the Series A Shares then outstanding (without regard to any limitations on conversion contained herein).

(18) Vote to Change the Terms of or Issue Series A Shares. In addition to any other rights provided by law, except where the vote or written consent of the holders of a greater number of shares is required by law or by another provision of the Second Amended and Restated Certificate, without first obtaining the affirmative vote at a meeting duly called for such purpose or the written consent without a meeting of the Required Holders, voting together as a single class, the Corporation shall not: (a) amend or repeal any provision of, or add any provision to, its Second Amended and Restated Certificate or Bylaws, or file any certificate of designations or articles of amendment of any series of shares of preferred stock, if such action would adversely alter or change in any respect the preferences, rights, privileges or powers, or restrictions provided for the benefit, of the Series A Shares, regardless of whether any such action shall be by means of amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Certificate or by merger, consolidation or otherwise; (b) increase or decrease (other than by conversion) the authorized number of Series A Shares; (c) without limiting any provision of Section 4.4(2), create or authorize (by reclassification or otherwise) any new class or series of shares that has a preference over or is on a parity with the Series A Shares with respect to dividends or the distribution of assets on the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation; (d) purchase, repurchase or redeem any shares of capital stock of the Corporation junior in rank to the Series A Shares (other than pursuant to equity incentive agreements (that have in good faith been approved by the Board) with employees giving the Corporation the right to repurchase shares upon the termination of services); (e) without limiting any provision of Section 4.4(2), pay dividends or make any other distribution on any shares of any capital stock of the Corporation junior in rank to the Series A Shares; (f) issue any Series A Shares other than pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement; or (g) without limiting any provision of Section 4.4(9), whether or not prohibited by the terms of the Series A Shares, circumvent a right of the Series A Shares.

(a) Stockholder Matters. Any stockholder action, approval or consent required, desired or otherwise sought by the Corporation pursuant to the DGCL, the Second Amended and Restated Certificate or otherwise with respect to the issuance of Series A Shares may be effected by written consent of the Corporation's stockholders or at a duly called meeting of the Corporation's stockholders, all in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the DGCL. This provision is intended to comply with the applicable sections of the DGCL permitting stockholder action, approval and consent affected by written consent in lieu of a meeting.

(b) Amendment. This Section 4.4 or any provision hereof may be amended by obtaining the affirmative vote at a meeting duly called for such purpose, or written consent without a meeting in accordance with the DGCL, of the Required Holders, voting separate as a single class, and with such other stockholder approval, if any, as may then be required pursuant to the DGCL and the Second Amended and Restated Certificate.

Section 5.1 Board Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (""Bylaws""), the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, and any Bylaws adopted by the stockholders; provided, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

(b) Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, the Board shall be divided into two classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I and Class II. The Board is authorized to assign members of the Board already in office to Class I or Class II. The term of the initial Class I Directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the term of the initial Class II Directors shall expire at the second annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate. At each annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, beginning with the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a two-year term. Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, if the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director.

Section 5.5 Preferred Stock - Directors. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article V, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) and such directors shall not be included in any of the classes created pursuant to this Article V unless expressly provided by such terms.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and provided further, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

Section 7.3 Action by Written Consent. Except as may be otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) relating to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected by a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders.

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any indemnitee by this Section 8.2 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.2 by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Section 8.2, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

ARTICLE X
AMENDMENT OF SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force that may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL; and, except as set forth in Article VIII, all rights, preferences and privileges of whatever nature herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article X.

Section 11.1 Forum. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, other employee, or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any director, officer, or employee of the Corporation arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any director, officer, or employee of the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (i) through (iv) above, any claim as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction; provided that the provisions of this Section 11.1 will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, KBL Merger Corp. IV has caused this Second Amended and Restated Certificate to be duly executed and acknowledged in its name and on its behalf by an authorized officer as of the date first set forth above.

Reference is made to the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of KBL Merger Corp. IV (the ""Second Amended and Restated Certificate""). In accordance with and pursuant to Section 4.4 of the Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the undersigned hereby elects to convert the number of shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the ""Series A Shares""), of KBL Merger Corp. IV, a Delaware corporation (the ""Corporation""), indicated below into shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the ""Common Stock""), of the Corporation, as of the date specified below.

(B) Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the holder of the Class C Special Voting Share and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The provision is found in ARTICLE X, which states that the Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate.

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""NA"". Although there is a provision that requires a vote of stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation, the excerpt does not specify the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment.

However, in Section 4.4, subsection (b), it is mentioned that the affirmative vote at a meeting duly called for such purpose, or written consent without a meeting in accordance with the DGCL, of the Required Holders, voting separate as a single class, is required to amend this Section 4.4 or any provision hereof. But the percentage of Required Holders is not specified.

Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""NA"". Since the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment is not specified, it is not possible to determine if it is a supermajority.

Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""NA"". Since the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment is not specified, it is not possible to determine if the supermajority requirement is only applied for a subset of articles.

The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws.

[Signature Page to Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation]","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The relevant provision is in Article X, which states that certain provisions of the Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation can only be altered, amended, or repealed with the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""66.67"". This is stated in Article X, which requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". The required percentage of 66.67% is indeed a supermajority, as it is greater than 50%.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Yes, Article IV, Article V, Article VI, Article VIII, Article IX and this Article X"". According to Article X, the supermajority requirement applies to these specific articles, which cannot be altered, amended, or repealed without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.

4. Pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (this ""Second Amended and Restated Certificate""), the Corporation will, amongst other things, change its name to PARTS iD, Inc.

5. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate, which both restates and amends the provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate, was duly adopted in accordance with Sections 228, 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended from time to time (the ""DGCL"").

6. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate shall become effective on the date of filing with Secretary of State of Delaware.

7. The text of the Amended and Restated Certificate is hereby restated and amended in its entirety to read as follows:

Section 4.2 Preferred Stock. Subject to Article IX of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the ""Board"") is hereby expressly authorized to provide out of the unissued shares of the Preferred Stock for one or more series of Preferred Stock and to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series and to fix the voting rights, if any, designations, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional, special and other rights, if any, of each such series and any qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, as shall be stated in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board providing for the issuance of such series and included in a certificate of designation (a ""Preferred Stock Designation"") filed pursuant to the DGCL, and the Board is hereby expressly vested with the authority to the full extent provided by law, now or hereafter, to adopt any such resolution or resolutions.

(i) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of the shares of Common Stock shall exclusively possess all voting power with respect to the Corporation.

(ii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each such share on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders of the Corporation on which the holders of the shares of Common Stock are entitled to vote.

(iii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, holders of the Class A Common Stock and holders of the Class F Common Stock, voting together as a single class, shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and on all other matters properly submitted to a vote of the stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), holders of shares of any series of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any amendment to any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock or other series of Common Stock if the holders of such affected series of Preferred Stock or Common Stock, as applicable, are entitled exclusively, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

The foregoing conversion ratio shall also be adjusted to account for any subdivision (by stock split, subdivision, exchange, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) or combination (by reverse stock split, exchange, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) or similar reclassification or recapitalization of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock into a greater or lesser number of shares occurring after the original filing of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate without a proportionate and corresponding subdivision, combination or similar reclassification or recapitalization of the outstanding shares of Class F Common Stock.

(iii) Voting. Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), for so long as any shares of Class F Common Stock shall remain outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without the prior vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the shares of Class F Common Stock then outstanding, voting separately as a single class, amend, alter or repeal any provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, if such amendment, alteration or repeal would alter or change the powers, preferences or relative, participating, optional or other or special rights of the Class F Common Stock. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the holders of Class F Common Stock may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of the outstanding Class F Common Stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares of Class F Common Stock were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which minutes of proceedings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. Prompt written notice of the taking of corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent of the holders of Class F Common Stock shall, to the extent required by law, be given to those holders of Class F Common Stock who have not consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for notice of such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders of Class F Common Stock to take the action were delivered to the Corporation.

Section 5.1 Board Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (""Bylaws""), the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, and any Bylaws adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation; provided, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

(b) Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, the Board shall be divided into two classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I and Class II. The Board is authorized to assign members of the Board already in office to Class I or Class II. The term of the initial Class I Directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the term of the initial Class II Directors shall expire at the second annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate. At each succeeding annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, beginning with the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, each of the successors elected to replace the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a two-year term or until the election and qualification of their respective successors in office, subject to their earlier death, resignation or removal. Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, if the number of directors that constitutes the Board is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board shorten the term of any incumbent director. Subject to the rights of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors pursuant to the terms of one or more series of Preferred Stock, the election of directors shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. The Board is hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or resolutions thereof, to assign members of the Board already in office to the aforesaid classes at the time this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (and therefore such classification) becomes effective in accordance with the DGCL. The Class I directors shall be Darryl T. F. McCall, Rahul Petkar, and Ann M. Schwister, with their successors to be elected and appointed at the annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation for the year ended 2020. The Class II directors shall be Edwin J. Rigaud, Richard White, Aditya Jha, and Prashant Pathak, with their successors to be elected and appointed at the annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation for the year ended 2021.

Section 5.5 Preferred Stock - Directors. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article V, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) and such directors shall not be included in any of the classes created pursuant to this Article V unless expressly provided by such terms.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of directors present at a regular or special meeting of the Board at which there is a quorum or by unanimous written consent. The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders of the Corporation to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and provided further, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

Section 7.3 Prohibition on Actions by Written Consent. Except as may be otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) relating to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders must be effected by a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders.

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any indemnitee by this Section 8.2 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.2 by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Section 8.2, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

(a) The provisions of this Article IX shall apply during the period commencing upon the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and terminating upon the consummation of the Corporation's initial Business Combination and no amendment to this Article IX shall be effective prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination unless approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-five percent (65%) of all then outstanding shares of the Common Stock.

(b) Immediately after the Offering, a certain amount of the net offering proceeds received by the Corporation in the Offering (including the proceeds of any exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option) and certain other amounts specified in the Corporation's registration statement on Form S-1, as initially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 25, 2017, as amended (the ""Registration Statement""), shall be deposited in a trust account (the ""Trust Account""), established for the benefit of the Public Stockholders (as defined below) pursuant to a trust agreement described in the Registration Statement. Except for the withdrawal of interest of up to $750,000 per annum to fund working capital requirements and to pay taxes, none of the funds held in the Trust Account (including the interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account) will be released from the Trust Account until the earliest to occur of (i) the completion of the initial Business Combination, (ii) the redemption of 100% of the Offering Shares (as defined below) if the Corporation is unable to complete its initial Business Combination by November 20, 2020 and (iii) the redemption of shares in connection with a vote seeking to amend any provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate relating to stockholders' rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity (as described in Section 9.7). Holders of shares of Common Stock included as part of the units sold in the Offering (the ""Offering Shares"") (whether such Offering Shares were purchased in the Offering or in the secondary market following the Offering and whether or not such holders are affiliates of Legacy Acquisition Sponsor I LLC (the ""Sponsor"") or officers or directors of the Corporation) are referred to herein as ""Public Stockholders.""

(a) Prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, the Corporation shall provide all holders of Offering Shares with the opportunity to have their Offering Shares redeemed upon the consummation of the initial Business Combination pursuant to, and subject to the limitations of, Sections 9.2(b) and 9.2(c) (such rights of such holders to have their Offering Shares redeemed pursuant to such Sections, the ""Redemption Rights"") hereof for cash equal to the applicable redemption price per share determined in accordance with Section 9.2(b) hereof (the ""Redemption Price""); provided, however, that the Corporation shall not redeem Offering Shares to the extent that such redemption would result in the Corporation's failure to have net tangible assets (as determined in accordance with Rule 3a51-1(g)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act"") (or any successor rule)) in excess of $5 million or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to the initial Business Combination upon consummation of the initial Business Combination (such limitation hereinafter called the ""Redemption Limitation""). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, there shall be no Redemption Rights or liquidating distributions with respect to any warrant issued pursuant to the Offering.

Section 9.4 Share Issuances. Prior to the consummation of the Corporation's initial Business Combination, the Corporation shall not issue any additional shares of capital stock of the Corporation that would entitle the holders thereof to receive funds from the Trust Account or vote on any initial Business Combination, on any pre-Business Combination activity or on any amendment to this Article IX

Section 9.7 Additional Redemption Rights. If, in accordance with Section 9.1(a), any amendment is made to this Article IX, the Public Stockholders shall be provided with the opportunity to redeem their Offering Shares upon the approval of any such amendment, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest not previously released to the Corporation of up to $750,000 to fund working capital requirements and pay its taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Offering Shares, provided, however, that any such amendment will be voided, and this Article IX will remain unchanged, if any stockholders who wish to redeem are unable to redeem due to the Redemption Limitation.

AMENDMENT OF SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force that may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL; and, except as set forth in Article VIII, all rights, preferences and privileges of whatever nature herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article XI; provided, however, that Article IX of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate may be amended only as provided therein.

If any provision or provisions (or any part thereof) of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any person or entity or circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, (i) the validity, legality and enforceability of such provisions in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) and the application of such provision to other persons or entities and circumstances shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (ii) the provisions of this Second Amended and Restated (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to permit the Corporation to protect its directors, officers, employees and agents from personal liability in respect of their faith service or for the benefit of the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by law.

**Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?**

Yes, there are several provisions that require a vote of stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it. For example, Article IX can be amended only as provided therein, and Section 9.7 provides that the Public Stockholders shall be provided with the opportunity to redeem their Offering Shares upon the approval of any amendment to Article IX.

The percentage of shareholders required for the amendment varies depending on the specific provision being amended. For example, Article IX can be amended only with the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-five percent (65%) of all then outstanding shares of the Common Stock. Section 9.7 provides that the Public Stockholders shall be provided with the opportunity to redeem their Offering Shares upon the approval of any amendment to Article IX, but it does not specify a specific percentage of shareholders required for the amendment.

**Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?**

Yes, the percentage required to amend Article IX is a supermajority, specifically sixty-five percent (65%) of all then outstanding shares of the Common Stock.

Such affirmative vote shall be required notwithstanding the fact that no vote may be required, or that a lesser percentage may be specified, by law or in any agreement with any Exchange or otherwise.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will go through the questions one by one.

Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt mentions several provisions that require a vote of shareholders to amend or repeal certain articles or provisions, such as Article 5.5, Article 53.1, and Article 239.

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""66.67"" (two-thirds). This is mentioned in Article 239, which requires the affirmative vote of members holding not less than two-thirds of the paid-up ordinary share capital of the Company for certain Business Transactions.

Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". A two-thirds majority is indeed a supermajority.

Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Yes"", the supermajority requirement is only applied for a subset of articles, specifically Business Transactions (as defined in Article 241.3) with or proposed by or on behalf of any Interested Person (as defined in Article 241.6) or any Affiliate (as defined in Article 241.1) of any Interested Person.

THREE: The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of this corporation is hereby amended and restated to read as follows:

B. Effective immediately upon the filing and effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the ""Effective Time""), each one share of the Company's Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Class A Common Stock""), that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be reclassified, redesignated and changed into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Common Stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Common Stock""), without any further action by the Company or any stockholder thereof. Each certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Class A Common Stock (each, a ""Prior Certificate"") shall, until surrendered to the Company in exchange for a certificate representing the same number of shares of Common Stock, automatically represent that number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Class A Common Stock represented by the Prior Certificate shall have been reclassified and redesignated.

D. Each outstanding share of Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders of the Company for their vote; provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon by law or pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock).

B. 1. BYLAW AMENDMENTS. The Board of Directors is expressly empowered to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company. Any adoption, amendment or repeal of the Bylaws of the Company by the Board of Directors shall require the approval of a majority of the authorized number of directors. The stockholders shall also have power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company; provided, however, that, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Company required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, such action by stockholders shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

B. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company shall provide indemnification of (and advancement of expenses to) directors, officers and agents of the Company (and any other persons to which applicable law permits the Company to provide indemnification) through Bylaw provisions, agreements with such agents or other persons, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise in excess of the indemnification and advancement otherwise permitted by such applicable law. If applicable law is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article VI to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director to the Company shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as so amended.

A. Unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and only if all such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: (A) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company; (B) any action or proceeding (including any class action) asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company's stockholders; (C) any action or proceeding (including any class action) asserting a claim against the Company or any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Company arising out of or pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company (as each may be amended from time to time); (D) any action or proceeding (including any class action) to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company (including any right, obligation or remedy thereunder); (E) any action or proceeding as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; or (F) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director, officer or other employee of the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court's having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. This Article VII shall not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

A. The Company reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, except as provided in paragraph B. of this Article VIII, and all rights conferred upon the stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

B. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any particular class or series of the Company required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any certificate of designation filed with respect to a series of Preferred Stock, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Articles V, VI, VII and VIII.

C. If any provision or provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any circumstance for any reason whatsoever, the validity, legality and enforceability of such provision in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

To the extent allowed by law, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any other analogous doctrine, shall not apply with respect to the Company or any of its officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, in circumstances where the application of any such doctrine would conflict with any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations they may have as of the date of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or in the future, and the Company renounces any expectancy that any of the directors or officers of the Company will offer any such corporate opportunity of which he or she may become aware to the Company, except, the doctrine of corporate opportunity shall apply with respect to any of the directors or officers of the Company with respect to a corporate opportunity that was offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company and (i) such opportunity is one the Company is legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Company to pursue and (ii) the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to the Company without violating any legal obligation.

FOUR: This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been duly approved by the Board of Directors of the Company.

FIVE: This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation was approved by the holders of the requisite number of shares of the Company. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been duly adopted in accordance with the provisions of Sections 242 and 245 of the DGCL by the stockholders of the Company.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be signed on this 21st day of December, 2020.

C. The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The Board of Directors of the Company (the ""Board of Directors"") is hereby expressly authorized to provide for the issue of all or any number of the shares of the Preferred Stock in one or more series, and to fix the number of shares and to determine or alter for each such series, such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designation, preferences, and relative, participating, optional, or other rights and such qualifications, limitations, or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of such shares and as may be permitted by the DGCL. The Board of Directors is also expressly authorized to increase (but not above the total number of authorized shares of the class) or decrease (but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding) the number of shares of any series subsequent to the issuance of shares of that series. In case the number of shares of any series shall be decreased in accordance with the foregoing sentence, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the stock of the Company entitled to vote thereon, without a separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or of any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to the terms of any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt states in Article VIII, Section B: ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Articles V, VI, VII and VIII.""

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""66.67"". The excerpt states in Article VIII, Section B: ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Articles V, VI, VII and VIII.""

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". The required percentage of 66.67% is indeed a supermajority.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Articles V, VI, VII and VIII"". The excerpt states in Article VIII, Section B that the supermajority requirement applies specifically to these articles.

Form of Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation

F. Effect of Modifications. Any amendment, repeal or modification of any provision contained in this Article EIGHTH shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to further limit or eliminate the liability of directors or officers) and shall not adversely affect any right or protection of any current or former director or officer of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or modification with respect to any acts or omissions occurring prior to such amendment, repeal or modification.

A. Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation. The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Certificate of Incorporation and the DGCL, and all rights, preferences and privileges herein conferred upon stockholders of the Corporation by and pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article ELEVENTH. In addition to any other vote that may be required by law, applicable stock exchange rule or the terms of any series of Preferred Stock, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend, alter, repeal or adopt any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, and in addition to any other vote that may be required by law, applicable stock exchange rule or the terms of any series of Preferred Stock, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend, alter, repeal or adopt any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with the purpose and intent of Article FIFTH, Article SIXTH, Article SEVENTH, Article EIGHTH, Article NINTH, Article TENTH or this Article ELEVENTH (including, without limitation, any such Article as renumbered as a result of any amendment, alteration, repeal or adoption of any other Article).

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be signed as of the 16th day of December, 2020.

B. Amendment of Bylaws. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by the DGCL, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The Bylaws may also be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders of the Corporation by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

A. Preferred Stock. The Board of Directors is expressly granted authority to issue shares of the Preferred Stock, in one or more series, and to fix for each such series such voting powers, full or limited, and such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and such qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issue of such series (a ""Preferred Stock Designation"") and as may be permitted by the GCL. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, without a separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to any Preferred Stock Designation.

B. Common Stock. Except as otherwise required by law or as otherwise provided in any Preferred Stock Designation, the holders of the Common Stock shall exclusively possess all voting power and each share of Common Stock shall have one vote. Subject to the rights of holders of any series of outstanding Preferred Stock, holders of shares of Common Stock shall have equal rights of participation in the dividends and other distributions in cash, stock, or property of the Corporation when, as and if declared thereon by the Board of Directors from time to time out of assets or funds of the Corporation legally available therefor and shall have equal rights to receive the assets and funds of the Corporation available for distribution to stockholders in the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary.","To answer the questions, I will go through the excerpt and identify the relevant provisions.

The excerpt contains provisions related to the amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and the voting power of shareholders.

For Question 1, I found the following provision:

""A. Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation.... In addition to any other vote that may be required by law, applicable stock exchange rule or the terms of any series of Preferred Stock, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend, alter, repeal or adopt any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation.""

This provision indicates that a vote of shareholders is required to amend the Certificate of Incorporation. Therefore, the answer to Question 1 is ""Yes"".

For Question 2, I found two different percentages mentioned:

* ""a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation"" (which is equivalent to 50%)
* ""75% of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation"" (which applies to amendments inconsistent with certain articles)

Since the question asks for the percentage required, I will answer with the higher percentage, which is ""75"".

For Question 3, since the required percentage is 75%, which is greater than 50%, the answer is ""Yes"", it is a supermajority.

For Question 4, I found that the supermajority requirement applies to amendments inconsistent with certain articles, specifically:

""Article FIFTH, Article SIXTH, Article SEVENTH, Article EIGHTH, Article NINTH, Article TENTH or this Article ELEVENTH""

Therefore, the answer to Question 4 is ""Articles FIFTH, SIXTH, SEVENTH, EIGHTH, NINTH, TENTH, ELEVENTH"".

Subject to the Act, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Supreme Court of the Province of British Columbia, Canada and the appellate courts therefrom, shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company; (ii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, or other employee of the Company to the Company; (iii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Act or these Articles (as either may be amended from time to time); or (iv) any action or proceeding asserting a claim otherwise related to the relationships among the Company, its affiliates and their respective shareholders, directors and/or officers, but this paragraph (iv) does not include claims related to the business carried on by the Company or such affiliates. Article 26.1 paragraphs (i) through (iv) does not include claims for which such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction. If any action or proceeding the subject matter of which is within the scope of the preceding sentence is filed in a Court other than the Supreme Court of the Province of British Columbia, Canada and the appellate courts therefrom (a ""Foreign Action"") in the name of any securityholder, such securityholder shall be deemed to have consented to (i) the personal jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the Province of British Columbia, Canada and the appellate courts therefrom, in connection with any action or proceeding brought in any such court to enforce the preceding sentence and (ii) having service of process made upon such securityholder in any such action or proceeding by service upon such securityholder's counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such securityholder. For the avoidance of doubt, this Article 26.1 shall not apply to any action brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any security of the Company shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article 26.1.

Except as required by the Act and except for the right to vote on all special resolutions and exceptional resolutions, the Non-Voting Common shares shall not have any voting rights; provided, however, the holders of Non-Voting Common shares shall be entitled to receive notice of and to attend any annual or special general meeting of the shareholders of the Company (in an observatory capacity, except with respect to any vote on special resolutions or exceptional resolutions). Each Non-Voting Common share shall entitle its holder to one (1) vote (voting together with the Common shares as a single class on an as-converted basis) with respect to all special resolutions and exceptional resolutions presented to the shareholders of the Company (except where only holders of another specified class of shares are entitled to vote pursuant to the provisions hereof or pursuant to the provisions of the Act).

Each Common share shall entitle its holder to one (1) vote at all meetings of the shareholders of the Company (except meetings at which only holders of another specified class of shares are entitled to vote pursuant to the provisions hereof or pursuant to the provisions of the Act).","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Unsure"" because the excerpt does not explicitly state the voting requirements for amending the Certificate of Incorporation. Although it mentions voting rights for shareholders, it does not specify the percentage of votes required to amend the Certificate.

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

Since the answer to question 1 is ""Unsure"", I will answer ""NA"" for this question.

1. The name of the Corporation is ""PropTech Acquisition Corporation"". The original certificate of incorporation of the Corporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on July 31, 2019. The Corporation filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on November 21, 2019 (the ""First Amended and Restated Certificate"").

2. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (this ""Second Amended and Restated Certificate""), which both restates and amends the provisions of the First Amended and Restated Certificate, was duly adopted in accordance with Sections 228, 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended from time to time (the ""DGCL"").

3. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate restates, integrates, and amends the provisions of the First Amended and Restated Certificate. Certain capitalized terms used in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate are defined where appropriate herein.

4. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate shall become effective on the date of filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

5. The text of the First Amended and Restated Certificate is hereby restated and amended in its entirety to read as follows:

(i) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of the Common Stock shall exclusively possess all voting power with respect to the Corporation.

(ii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each such share on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders of the Corporation on which the holders of the Common Stock are entitled to vote.

(iii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, holders of the Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and on all other matters properly submitted to a vote of the stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), holders of shares of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any amendment to any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series of Preferred Stock are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

Section 5.1. Board Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, as it may be further amended from time to time, or the Amended and Restated By-Laws of the Corporation (as amended from time to time in accordance with the provisions hereof and thereof, the ""By-Laws""), the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL and this Second Amended and Restated Certificate.

(b) Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, the Board shall be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I, Class II and Class III. The Board is authorized to assign members of the Board already in office to Class I, Class II or Class III. The term of the initial Class I Directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the term of the initial Class II Directors shall expire at the second annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the term of the initial Class III Directors shall expire at the third annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate. At each succeeding annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, beginning with the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, each of the successors elected to replace the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term or until the election and qualification of their respective successors in office, subject to their earlier death, resignation or removal. Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, if the number of directors that constitute the Board is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board shorten the term of any incumbent director. Subject to the rights of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors pursuant to the terms of one or more series of Preferred Stock, the election of directors shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. The Board is hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or resolutions thereof, to assign members of the Board already in office to the aforesaid classes at the time this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (and therefore such classification) becomes effective in accordance with the DGCL.

Section 5.5. Preferred Stock - Directors. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article V, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) and such directors shall not be included in any of the classes created pursuant to this Article V unless expressly provided by such terms.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By-Laws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By-Laws. The By-Laws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By-Laws; and provided further, however, that no By-Laws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such By-Laws had not been adopted.

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any indemnitee by this Section 8.2 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate as it may be further amended from time to time, the By-Laws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.2 by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Section 8.2, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

Section 9.1. To the extent allowed by law, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any other analogous doctrine, shall not apply with respect to the Corporation or any of its officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, in circumstances where the application of any such doctrine would conflict with any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations they may have as of the date of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or in the future, and the Corporation renounces any expectancy that any of the directors or officers of the Corporation will offer any such corporate opportunity of which he or she may become aware to the Corporation, except, the doctrine of corporate opportunity shall apply with respect to any of the directors or officers of the Corporation with respect to a corporate opportunity that was offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation and (i) such opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Corporation to pursue and (ii) the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to the Corporation without violating any legal obligation.

Section 9.2. Neither the alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article IX, nor the adoption of any provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) inconsistent with this Article IX, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article IX in respect of any business opportunity first identified or any other matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Article IX, would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration, amendment, addition, repeal or adoption. This Article IX shall not limit any protections or defenses available to, or indemnification or advancement rights of, any director or officer of the Corporation under this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the By-laws or applicable law.

ARTICLE X
AMENDMENT OF SECOND amended and restated CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force that may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL; and, except as set forth in Article VIII, all rights, preferences and privileges of whatever nature herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article X. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or any provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any particular class or series of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or any Preferred Stock Designation filed with respect to a series of Preferred Stock, the affirmative vote of the stockholders holding at least 66.7% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Article V.

Section 11.1. Forum. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable law, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the By-Laws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder's counsel, except any action (A) as to which the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction, or (D) any action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as to which the Court of Chancery and the federal district court for the District of Delaware shall have concurrent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 11.1 will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws (the ""Bylaws"") of the Corporation, the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL, this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate and any Bylaws adopted by the stockholders; provided, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

AMENDMENT OF FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

[Signature page to Live Oak Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate]

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power to adopt, amend, alter, change, add or repeal the Bylaws , without any action on the part of the stockholders, by the vote of at least a majority of the directors of the Corporation then in office. The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of the shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting as one class.","To answer the questions, I will go through the excerpt and identify the relevant provisions.

The excerpt is a Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of a company. It outlines the company's structure, powers, and procedures for amending the certificate.

For Question 1, I found a provision in ARTICLE XI that states the Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change, add or repeal any provision contained in this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate. However, this provision does not explicitly state that a vote of shareholders is required to amend the Certificate. But later on, I found a provision that states ""The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of the shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting as one class."" Although this provision is related to Bylaws, it implies that a similar provision might exist for the Certificate of Incorporation. However, I did not find an explicit statement that requires a vote of shareholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation. Therefore, I will answer Question 1 as ""Unsure"".

Since Question 1's answer is not ""Yes"", I will answer Questions 2, 3, and 4 as ""NA"".

(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Certificate of Incorporation or as provided by law, each holder of Common Stock, as such, shall be entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held of record by such holder on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote; provided, however, that to the fullest extent permitted by law, holders of Common Stock, as such, shall have no voting power with respect to, and shall not be entitled to vote on, any amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) or pursuant to the DGCL.

Section 5.1 By-Laws. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by the DGCL, the Board is expressly authorized to make, amend, alter, change, add to or repeal the by-laws of the Corporation (as the same may be amended from time to time, the ""By-Laws"") without the assent or vote of the stockholders in any manner not inconsistent with the laws of the State of Delaware or this Certificate of Incorporation.

Section 8.1 Limited Liability of Directors. To the fullest extent permitted by law, no director of the Corporation will have any personal liability to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Neither the amendment nor the repeal of this Article VIII shall eliminate, reduce or otherwise adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the Corporation existing prior to such amendment or repeal.

(G) Any alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article X shall require the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. Neither the alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article X, nor the adoption of any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) inconsistent with this Article X, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article X in respect of any business opportunity first identified or any other matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Article X, would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration, amendment, addition, repeal or adoption.

Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, other employee, agent or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, or any claim for aiding and abetting such alleged breach, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any current or former director, officer, other employee, agent or stockholder of the Corporation (a) arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, this Certificate of Incorporation (as it may be amended or restated, including by means of certificate of designation relating to preferred stock) or the By-Laws or (b) as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Delaware Court of Chancery or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any current or former director, officer, other employee, agent or stockholder of the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the law of the State of Delaware shall, as to any action in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), to the fullest extent permitted by law, be solely and exclusively brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to any claim (a) as to which the Delaware Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within 10 days following such determination), (b) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Delaware Court of Chancery, or (c) arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Article XII will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum. If any action the subject matter of which is within the scope of the forum provisions is filed in a court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (a ""foreign action"") in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an ""enforcement action""); and (y) having service of process made upon such stockholder in any such enforcement action by service upon such stockholder's counsel in the foreign action as agent for such stockholder. Failure to enforce the foregoing provisions would cause the Corporation irreparable harm and the Corporation shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, to enforce the foregoing provisions. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article XII.

Section 13.1 Amendments. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, in addition to any vote required by law, the following provisions in this Certificate of Incorporation may be amended, altered, repealed or rescinded, in whole or in part, or any provision inconsistent therewith or herewith may be adopted, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class: Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article IX, Article X, Article XII and this Article XIII. Except as expressly provided in the foregoing sentence and the remainder of this Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock), this Certificate of Incorporation may be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

(2) Except as otherwise provided in this Certificate of Incorporation or required by applicable law, the holders of Common Stock having the right to vote in respect of such Common Stock shall vote together as a single class (or, if the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote together with the holders of Common Stock having the right to vote in respect of such Common Stock, as a single class with the holders of such other series of Preferred Stock) on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders having voting rights generally.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

For other sections, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors is required.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

Yes, the 66 2/3% requirement is a supermajority.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

THREE: The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of this corporation is hereby amended and restated to read as follows:

B. Effective immediately upon the filing and effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the ""Effective Time""), each one share of the Corporation's Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Class A Common Stock""), that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be reclassified, redesignated and changed into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Common Stock of the Corporation, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Common Stock""), without any further action by the Corporation or any stockholder thereof. Each certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Class A Common Stock (each, a ""Prior Certificate"") shall, until surrendered to the Corporation in exchange for a certificate representing the same number of shares of Common Stock, automatically represent that number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Class A Common Stock represented by the Prior Certificate shall have been reclassified and redesignated.

D. Each outstanding share of Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders of the Corporation for their vote; provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon by law or pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock).

B. 1. BYLAW AMENDMENTS. The Board of Directors is expressly empowered to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation.

The stockholders shall also have power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation; provided, however, that, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, such action by stockholders shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

B. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation shall provide indemnification of (and advancement of expenses to) directors, officers and agents of the Corporation (and any other persons to which applicable law permits the Corporation to provide indemnification) through Bylaw provisions, agreements with such agents or other persons, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise in excess of the indemnification and advancement otherwise permitted by such applicable law. If applicable law is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article VI to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director to the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as so amended.

A. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and only if all such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) and any appellate court therefrom shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the following claims or causes of action under the Delaware statutory or common law: (A) any derivative claim or cause of action brought on behalf of the Corporation; (B) any claim or cause of action for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Corporation, to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders; (C) any claim or cause of action against the Corporation or any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Corporation, arising out of or pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws (as each may be amended from time to time); (D) any claim or cause of action seeking to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws (as each may be amended from time to time, including any right, obligation, or remedy thereunder); (E) any claim or cause of action as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and (F) any claim or cause of action against the Corporation or any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Corporation, governed by the internal-affairs doctrine, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. This Section D of Article VI shall not apply to claims or causes of action brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""1933 Act""), or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

C. Any person or entity holding, owning or otherwise acquiring any interest in any security of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

A. The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, except as provided in paragraph B. of this Article VIII, and all rights conferred upon the stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

B.

C. If any provision or provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any circumstance for any reason whatsoever, the validity, legality and enforceability of such provision in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

To the extent allowed by law, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any other analogous doctrine, shall not apply with respect to the Corporation or any of its officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, in circumstances where the application of any such doctrine would conflict with any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations they may have as of the date of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or in the future, and the Corporation renounces any expectancy that any of the directors or officers of the Corporation will offer any such corporate opportunity of which he or she may become aware to the Corporation, except, the doctrine of corporate opportunity shall apply with respect to any of the directors or officers of the Corporation with respect to a corporate opportunity that was offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation and (i) such opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Corporation to pursue and (ii) the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to the Corporation without violating any legal obligation.

The Board of Directors is also expressly authorized to increase (but not above the total number of authorized shares of the class) or decrease (but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding) the number of shares of any series subsequent to the issuance of shares of that series. In case the number of shares of any series shall be decreased in accordance with the foregoing sentence, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, without a separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or of any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to the terms of any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation

The Corporation reserves the right to amend or repeal this Certificate in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute and this Certificate, and all rights conferred upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt states that ""Except as otherwise required by this Certificate or by law, whenever any vote of the holders of capital stock of the Corporation is required to amend or repeal any provision of this Certificate, such amendment or repeal shall require the affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote on such amendment or repeal, and the affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote thereon as a class, at a duly constituted meeting of stockholders called expressly for such purpose.""

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""No"" for the general provision, but ""Yes"" for specific sections. The general provision requires a majority vote, which is 50%. However, certain sections, such as Article V, Section 1, Article V, Section 2, Article VI, Section 3, and Article VII, require a two-thirds (2/3) vote, which is a supermajority.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Yes"". The supermajority requirement of two-thirds (2/3) is applied to specific sections, including Article V, Section 1, Article V, Section 2, Article VI, Section 3, and Article VII.

3. This Amended Restated Certificate of Incorporation restates, integrates and amends the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation.

4. This Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation was duly adopted by joint written consent of the directors and stockholders of the Corporation in accordance with the applicable provisions of Sections 141(f), 228, 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (""GCL"").

5. The text of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation is hereby amended and restated to read in full as follows:

A. The personal liability of the directors of the Corporation to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of his or her fiduciary duty as director is hereby eliminated to the fullest extent permitted by the GCL. Any amendment, repeal or modification of this Article Seventh, or the adoption of any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article Seventh, shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such amendment, repeal or modification. If the GCL is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article Seventh to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the GCL as so amended.

B. The Corporation, to the full extent permitted by Section 145 of the GCL, (i) shall indemnify, advance expenses to and hold harmless (a) its current and former directors and officers and (b) any person who, while a director or officer, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, from and against any and all of the expenses, liabilities, or other matters referred to in or covered by said section as amended or supplemented (or any successor); provided, however, that except with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification or an advancement of expenses, the Corporation shall not be required to indemnify or advance expenses to any such director or officer in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such director or officer unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors and (ii) may provide indemnification or advance expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation or other persons as set forth in the Bylaws of the Corporation and on such terms and conditions and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors in its sole and absolute discretion. Any amendment, repeal or modification of this Article Seventh shall not adversely affect any rights or protection existing hereunder with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

A. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery (the ""Chancery Court"") of the State of Delaware (or, in the event that the Chancery Court does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state courts of the State of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation arising pursuant to any provision of the GCL or this Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time), (iv) any action or proceeding to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of this Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws (including any right, obligation, or remedy thereunder) or (v) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Paragraph A will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Ninth: From time to time any of the provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation may be amended, altered, changed or repealed, and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force may be added or inserted in the manner and at the time prescribed by said laws, and all rights at any time conferred upon the stockholders of the Corporation by this Certificate of Incorporation are granted subject to the provisions of this Article Ninth; provided that in addition to the vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of voting stock of the Corporation representing at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend, alter or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, Articles Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth or Ninth of this Certificate of Incorporation.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be signed by its Chief Executive Officer, as of the 19th day of March, 2021.

B. In furtherance and not in limitation of the rights, power, privileges and discretionary authority granted or conferred by the GCL or other statutes or laws of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors shall have the power, without the assent or vote of the stockholders, to make, alter, amend, change, add to or repeal the Bylaws as provided in the Bylaws. The Corporation may in its Bylaws confer powers upon its Board of Directors in addition to the foregoing and in addition to the powers and authorities expressly conferred upon the Board of Directors by applicable law. The stockholders shall also have power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation; provided, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of the Bylaws of the Corporation; provided, however, that if the Board of Directors unanimously approves or unanimously recommends that stockholders approve such adoption, amendment or repeal, such adoption, amendment or repeal shall only require, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of the capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of the majority of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation present and entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class.

A. Preferred Stock. The Board of Directors is expressly granted authority to issue shares of the Preferred Stock, in one or more series, and to fix for each such series such voting powers, full or limited, and such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and such qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issue of such series (a ""Preferred Stock Designation"") and as may be permitted by the GCL. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, without a separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to any Preferred Stock Designation.

1. General. The voting, dividend, liquidation, conversion and stock split rights of the holders of the Common Stock are subject to and qualified by the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock of any series as may be designated by the Board of Directors upon any issuance of the Preferred Stock of any series. The number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the GCL.

E. Subject to any rights of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock to elect directors, any director or the entire Board may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. For purposes of this Paragraph E, ""cause"" shall mean, with respect to any director, (i) the willful failure by such director to perform, or the gross negligence of such director in performing, the duties of a director, (ii) the engaging by such director in willful or serious misconduct that is injurious to the Corporation, or (iii) the conviction of such director of, or the entering by such director of a plea of nolo contendere to, a crime that constitutes a felony.","To answer the questions, I will go through the excerpt and identify the relevant provisions.

3. This Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation was duly adopted in accordance with the applicable provisions of Sections 103, 228, 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (""DGCL""); and

4. The text of the Original Certificate of Incorporation is hereby amended and restated to read, in full, as follows:

(a) The holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each such share on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders on which the holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to vote. Except as otherwise required by law or this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation), at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders the Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and on all other matters properly submitted to a vote of the stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law or this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including a Preferred Stock Designation), holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any amendment to any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation.)

Fifth: The Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes: Class A, Class B and Class C. The number of directors in each class shall be as nearly equal as possible. The initial term of office for the directors in Class A shall expire at the first Annual Meeting of Stockholders following the effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation; the initial term of office for the directors in Class B shall expire at the second Annual Meeting of Stockholders following the effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation; and the initial term of office for the directors in Class C shall expire at the third Annual Meeting of Stockholders following the effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. At each Annual Meeting of Stockholders following the effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms expire shall be elected to hold office for a three-year term and until the election and qualification of their respective successors in office. Except as the DGCL may otherwise require and subject to the then-applicable terms of the Stockholders' Agreement, among the Corporation and certain of its stockholders, dated as of August 21, 2020, as it may be amended, restated, supplemented and otherwise modified from time to time, in the interim between Annual Meetings of Stockholders or Special Meetings of Stockholders called for the election of directors and/or the removal of one or more directors and the filling of any vacancy in that connection, newly created directorships and any vacancies in the Board of Directors, including unfilled vacancies resulting from the removal of directors for cause, may be filled by the vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, although less than a quorum (as defined in the Corporation's bylaws), or by the sole remaining director. All directors shall hold office until the expiration of their respective terms of office or, if earlier, their respective death, resignation or removal and until their successors shall have been elected and qualified. A director elected to fill a vacancy resulting from the death, resignation or removal of a director shall serve for the remainder of the full term of the director whose death, resignation or removal shall have created such vacancy and until his successor shall have been elected and qualified. In case of any increase or decrease, from time to time, in the number of directors, the number of directors in each class shall be apportioned as nearly equal as possible. The Board of Directors is authorized to assign members of the Board of Directors already in office, or those filling vacancies resulting from an increase in the size of the Board of Directors, to Class A, Class B, or Class C, with such assignment to become effective, with respect to members of the Board of Directors already in office, as of the initial effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and, with respect to members filling vacancies resulting from an increase in the size of the Board of Directors, upon such appointment or election, as applicable.

A. Except as otherwise required by the DGCL or as provided in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors.

D. Except as may be otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation) relating to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected by a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders; provided, however, that prior to the first date on which the Sponsor Group (as defined herein) and their respective successors and Affiliates (as defined herein) cease collectively to have beneficial ownership (directly or indirectly) of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation that is approved in advance by the Board may be effected without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote of stockholders, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is or are signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. The term ""beneficial ownership"" shall be determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

Eighth: A. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, and to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders in such capacity, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Corporation's bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (i) through (iv) above, any claim as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction.

Tenth : The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force that may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the DGCL; and, except as set forth in Article SEVENTH, all rights, preferences and privileges of whatever nature herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article TENTH.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be signed by an authorized officer this 21st day of August, 2020.

B. Preferred Stock. The Board of Directors is expressly granted authority to issue shares of the Preferred Stock, in one or more series, and to fix for each such series such voting powers, full or limited, and such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and such qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issue of such series (a ""Preferred Stock Designation"") and as may be permitted by the DGCL.

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The relevant provision is in Article Tenth, which states that the Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""NA"" for the general amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation. However, for the amendment of the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock, the required percentage is ""50"" (a majority of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors).

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""No"" for the amendment of the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock, as it requires a simple majority. However, for the general amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation, the answer is ""NA"" as no specific percentage is mentioned.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""NA"" for the general amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation. However, for the amendment of the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock, the answer is ""No"" as it applies to all outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation.

Section 12.2 Amendment of Bylaws. The Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation. Any adoption, amendment or repeal of the Bylaws by the Board of Directors shall require the approval of a majority of the Whole Board.

**Question 3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?**
